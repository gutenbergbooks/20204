<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The following lectures, drawn up under the pressure of
more imperative and quite otherwise directed work, contain
many passages which stand in need of support, and some, I
do not doubt, more or less of correction, which I always prefer
to receive openly from the better knowledge of friends,
after setting down my own impressions of the matter in
clearness as far as they reach, than to guard myself against
by submitting my manuscript, before publication, to annotators
whose stricture or suggestion I might often feel pain in
refusing, yet hesitation in admitting.</p>

<p>But though thus hastily, and to some extent incautiously,
thrown into form, the statements in the text are founded on
patient and, in all essential particulars, accurately recorded
observations of the sky, during fifty years of a life of solitude
and leisure; and in all they contain of what may seem to
the reader questionable, or astonishing, are guardedly and
absolutely true.</p>

<p>In many of the reports given by the daily press, my assertion
of radical change, during recent years, in weather aspect
was scouted as imaginary, or insane. I am indeed, every day
of my yet spared life, more and more grateful that my mind
is capable of imaginative vision, and liable to the noble
dangers of delusion which separate the speculative intellect
of humanity from the dreamless instinct of brutes: but I
have been able, during all active work, to use or refuse my
power of contemplative imagination, with as easy command
of it as a physicist's of his telescope: the times of morbid are
just as easily distinguished by me from those of healthy
vision, as by men of ordinary faculty, dream from waking;
nor is there a single fact stated in the following pages which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv" href="#Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
I have not verified with a chemist's analysis, and a geometer's
precision.</p>

<p>The first lecture is printed, with only addition here and
there of an elucidatory word or phrase, precisely as it was
given on the 4th February. In repeating it on the 11th, I
amplified several passages, and substituted for the concluding
one, which had been printed with accuracy in most of the
leading journals, some observations which I thought calculated
to be of more general interest. To these, with the
additions in the first text, I have now prefixed a few explanatory
notes, to which numeral references are given in the
pages they explain, and have arranged the fragments in connection
clear enough to allow of their being read with ease
as a second Lecture.</p>

<h2>THE STORM-CLOUD OF THE NINETEENTH<br />
CENTURY.</h2>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Let me first assure my audience that I have no <i>arri&egrave;re
pens&eacute;e</i> in the title chosen for this lecture. I might, indeed,
have meant, and it would have been only too like me to mean,
any number of things by such a title;&mdash;but, to-night, I mean
simply what I have said, and propose to bring to your notice
a series of cloud phenomena, which, so far as I can weigh
existing evidence, are peculiar to our own times; yet which
have not hitherto received any special notice or description
from meteorologists.</p>

<p>So far as the existing evidence, I say, of former literature
can be interpreted, the storm-cloud&mdash;or more accurately
plague-cloud, for it is not always stormy&mdash;which I am about
to describe to you, never was seen but by now living, or
<i>lately</i> living eyes. It is not yet twenty years that this&mdash;I
may well call it, wonderful, cloud has been, in its essence,
recognizable. There is no description of it, so far as I have
read, by any ancient observer. Neither Homer nor Virgil,
neither Aristophanes nor Horace, acknowledge any such
clouds among those compelled by Jove. Chaucer has no
word of them, nor Dante;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Milton none, nor Thomson. In
modern times, Scott, Wordsworth and Byron are alike unconscious
of them; and the most observant and descriptive
of scientific men, De Saussure, is utterly silent concerning
them. Taking up the traditions of air from the year before
Scott's death, I am able, by my own constant and close
observation, to certify you that in the forty following years
(1831 to 1871 approximately&mdash;for the phenomena in ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" href="#Page_2">[2]</a></span>tion
came on gradually)&mdash;no such clouds as these are, and
are now often for months without intermission, were ever
seen in the skies of England, France, or Italy.</p>

<p>In those old days, when weather was fine, it was luxuriously
fine; when it was bad&mdash;it was often abominably
bad, but it had its fit of temper and was done with it&mdash;it
didn't sulk for three months without letting you see the sun,&mdash;nor
send you one cyclone inside out, every Saturday afternoon,
and another outside in, every Monday morning.</p>

<p>In fine weather the sky was either blue or clear in its light;
the clouds, either white or golden, adding to, not abating, the
luster of the sky. In wet weather, there were two different
species of clouds,&mdash;those of beneficent rain, which for distinction's
sake I will call the non-electric rain-cloud, and
those of storm, usually charged highly with electricity. The
beneficent rain-cloud was indeed often extremely dull and
gray for days together, but gracious nevertheless, felt to be
doing good, and often to be delightful after drought; capable
also of the most exquisite coloring, under certain conditions;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and continually traversed in clearing by the rainbow:&mdash;and,
secondly, the storm-cloud, always majestic, often
dazzlingly beautiful, and felt also to be beneficent in its own
way, affecting the mass of the air with vital agitation, and
purging it from the impurity of all morbific elements.</p>

<p>In the entire system of the Firmament, thus seen and
understood, there appeared to be, to all the thinkers of those
ages, the incontrovertible and unmistakable evidence of a
Divine Power in creation, which had fitted, as the air for
human breath, so the clouds for human sight and nourishment;&mdash;the
Father who was in heaven feeding day by day
the souls of His children with marvels, and satisfying them
with bread, and so filling their hearts with food and gladness.</p>

<p>Their <i>hearts</i>, you will observe, it is said, not merely their
bellies,&mdash;or indeed not at all, in this sense, their bellies&mdash;but
the heart itself, with its blood for this life, and its faith
for the next. The opposition between this idea and the
notions of our own time may be more accurately expressed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" href="#Page_3">[3]</a></span>
modification of the Greek than of the English sentence. The
old Greek is&mdash;</p>

&#8053;&#956;&#8182;&#957;.</p>

<p>filling with meat, and cheerfulness, our hearts. The modern
Greek should be&mdash;</p>

<p class="greek">

<p>filling with wind, and foolishness, our stomachs.</p>

<p>You will not think I waste your time in giving you two
cardinal examples of the sort of evidence which the higher
forms of literature furnish respecting the cloud-phenomena
of former times.</p>

<p>When, in the close of my lecture on landscape last year at
Oxford, I spoke of stationary clouds as distinguished from
passing ones, some blockheads wrote to the papers to say that
clouds never were stationary. Those foolish letters were so
far useful in causing a friend to write me the pretty one I
am about to read to you, quoting a passage about clouds in
Homer which I had myself never noticed, though perhaps
the most beautiful of its kind in the Iliad. In the fifth
book, after the truce is broken, and the aggressor Trojans are
rushing to the onset in a tumult of clamor and charge,
Homer says that the Greeks, abiding them "stood like
clouds." My correspondent, giving the passage, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

reading Homer by the open window, and came upon the
lines&mdash;</p>

<p>'But they stood, like the clouds which the Son of Kronos
stablishes in calm upon the mountains, motionless, when the
rage of the North and of all the fiery winds is asleep.' As I
finished these lines, I raised my eyes, and looking across the
gulf, saw a long line of clouds resting on the top of its hills.
The day was windless, and there they stayed, hour after
hour, without any stir or motion. I remember how I was
delighted at the time, and have often since that day thought
on the beauty and the truthfulness of Homer's simile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this little fact may interest you, at a time when
you are attacked for your description of clouds.</p>

<p>With this bit of noonday from Homer, I will read you a
sunset and a sunrise from Byron. That will enough express
to you the scope and sweep of all glorious literature, from the
orient of Greece herself to the death of the last Englishman
who loved her.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I will read you from 'Sardanapalus' the
address of the Chaldean priest Beleses to the sunset, and of
the Greek slave, Myrrha, to the morning.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em;">"The sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,<br />

A beam of hope athwart the future years,<br />
As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!<br />
I am thy worshiper, thy priest, thy servant&mdash;<br />
I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,<br />
And bow'd my head beneath thy mid-day beams,<br />
When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watch'd<br />
For thee, and after thee, and pray'd to thee,<br />
And sacrificed to thee, and read, and fear'd thee,<br />
And ask'd of thee, and thou hast answer'd&mdash;but<br />
Only to thus much. While I speak, he sinks&mdash;<br />
Is gone&mdash;and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,<br />
To the delighted west, which revels in<br />
Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is<br />
Death, so it be but glorious? 'T is a sunset;<br />
And mortals may be happy to resemble<br />
The gods but in decay."<br />

<p>Thus the Chaldean priest, to the brightness of the setting
sun. Hear now the Greek girl, Myrrha, of his rising.</p>

</div></div>

<p>How often <i>now</i>&mdash;young maids of London,&mdash;do you make
<i>sunrise</i> the 'haunted epoch' of either?</p>

<p>Thus much, then, of the skies that used to be, and clouds
"more lovely than the unclouded sky," and of the temper of
their observers. I pass to the account of clouds that <i>are</i>,
and&mdash;I say it with sorrow&mdash;of the <i>dis</i>temper of <i>their</i> observers.</p>

<p>But the general division which I have instituted between
bad-weather and fair-weather clouds must be more carefully
carried out in the sub-species, before we can reason of it
farther: and before we begin talk either of the sub-genera
and sub-species, or super-genera and super-species of cloud,
perhaps we had better define what <i>every</i> cloud is, and must
be, to begin with.</p>

<p>Every cloud that can be, is thus primarily definable:
"Visible vapor of water floating at a certain height in the
air." The second clause of this definition, you see, at once
implies that there is such a thing as visible vapor of water
which does <i>not</i> float at a certain height in the air. You are
all familiar with one extremely cognizable variety of that
sort of vapor&mdash;London Particular; but that especial blessing
of metropolitan society is only a strongly-developed and
highly-seasoned condition of a form of watery vapor which
exists just as generally and widely at the bottom of the air,
as the clouds do&mdash;on what, for convenience' sake, we may
call the top of it;&mdash;only as yet, thanks to the sagacity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7">[7]</a></span>
scientific men, we have got no general name for the bottom
cloud, though the whole question of cloud nature begins in
this broad fact, that you have one kind of vapor that lies to
a certain depth on the ground, and another that floats at a
certain height in the sky. Perfectly definite, in both cases,
the surface level of the earthly vapor, and the roof level of
the heavenly vapor, are each of them drawn within the depth
of a fathom. Under <i>their</i> line, drawn for the day and for
the hour, the clouds will not stoop, and above <i>theirs,</i> the
mists will not rise. Each in their own region, high or deep,
may expatiate at their pleasure; within that, they climb, or
decline,&mdash;within that they congeal or melt away; but below
their assigned horizon the surges of the cloud sea may not
sink, and the floods of the mist lagoon may not be swollen.</p>

<p>That is the first idea you have to get well into your minds
concerning the abodes of this visible vapor; next, you have
to consider the manner of its visibility. Is it, you have to
ask, with cloud vapor, as with most other things, that they
are seen when they are there, and not seen when they are
not there? or has cloud vapor so much of the ghost in it, that
it can be visible or invisible as it likes, and may perhaps be
all unpleasantly and malignantly there, just as much when
we don't see it, as when we do? To which I answer, comfortably
and generally, that, on the whole, a cloud is where
you see it, and isn't where you don't; that, when there's an
evident and honest thundercloud in the northeast, you
needn't suppose there's a surreptitious and slinking one in the
northwest;&mdash;when there's a visible fog at Bermondsey, it
doesn't follow there's a spiritual one, more than usual, at the
West End: and when you get up to the clouds, and can
walk into them or out of them, as you like, you find when
you're in them they wet your whiskers, or take out your
curls, and when you're out of them, they don't; and therefore
you may with probability assume&mdash;not with certainty, observe,
but with probability&mdash;that there's more water in the
air where it damps your curls than where it doesn't. If
it gets much denser than that, it will begin to rain; and
then you may assert, certainly with safety, that there is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8">[8]</a></span>
shower in one place, and not in another; and not allow the
scientific people to tell you that the rain is everywhere, but
palpable in Tooley Street, and impalpable in Grosvenor
Square.</p>

<p>That, I say, is broadly and comfortably so on the whole,&mdash;and
yet with this kind of qualification and farther condition
in the matter. If you watch the steam coming strongly out
of an engine-funnel,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;at the top of the funnel it is transparent,&mdash;you
can't see it, though it is more densely and intensely
there than anywhere else. Six inches out of the funnel it
becomes snow-white,&mdash;you see it, and you see it, observe,
exactly where it is,&mdash;it is then a real and proper cloud.
Twenty yards off the funnel it scatters and melts away; a
little of it sprinkles you with rain if you are underneath it,
but the rest disappears; yet it is still there;&mdash;the surrounding
air does not absorb it all into space in a moment; there
is a gradually diffusing current of invisible moisture at the
end of the visible stream&mdash;an invisible, yet quite substantial,
vapor; but not, according to our definition, a cloud, for a
cloud is vapor <i>visible</i>.</p>

<p>Then the next bit of the question, of course, is, What
makes the vapor visible, when it is so? Why is the compressed
steam transparent, the loose steam white, the dissolved
steam transparent again?</p>

<p>The scientific people tell you that the vapor becomes visible,
and chilled, as it expands. Many thanks to them; but
can they show us any reason why particles of water should
be more opaque when they are separated than when they are
close together, or give us any idea of the difference of the
state of a particle of water, which won't <i>sink</i> in the air,
from that of one that won't <i>rise</i> in it?<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>And here I must parenthetically give you a little word of,
I will venture to say, extremely useful, advice about scientific
people in general. Their first business is, of course, to tell
you things that are so, and do happen,&mdash;as that, if you warm
water, it will boil; if you cool it, it will freeze; and if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" href="#Page_9">[9]</a></span>
put a candle to a cask of gunpowder, it will blow you up.
Their second, and far more important business, is to tell you
what you had best do under the circumstances,&mdash;put the
kettle on in time for tea; powder your ice and salt, if you
have a mind for ices; and obviate the chance of explosion
by not making the gunpowder. But if, beyond this safe
and beneficial business, they ever try to <i>explain</i> anything to
you, you may be confident of one of two things,&mdash;either that
they know nothing (to speak of) about it, or that they have
only seen one side of it&mdash;and not only haven't seen, but
usually have no mind to see, the other. When, for instance,
Professor Tyndall explains the twisted beds of the Jungfrau
to you by intimating that the Matterhorn is growing flat;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or
the clouds on the lee side of the Matterhorn by the wind's rubbing
against the windward side of it,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;you may be pretty
sure the scientific people don't know much (to speak of) yet,
either about rock-beds, or cloud-beds. And even if the explanation,
so to call it, be sound on one side, windward or lee,
you may, as I said, be nearly certain it won't do on the other.
Take the very top and center of scientific interpretation by
the greatest of its masters: Newton explained to you&mdash;or at
least was once supposed to have explained&mdash;why an apple
fell; but he never thought of explaining the exactly correlative,
but infinitely more difficult question, how the apple got
up there!</p>

<p>You will not, therefore, so please you, expect me to explain
anything to you,&mdash;I have come solely and simply to put
before you a few facts, which you can't see by candlelight, or
in railroad tunnels, but which are making themselves now so
very distinctly felt as well as seen, that you may perhaps
have to roof, if not wall, half London afresh before we are
many years older.</p>

<p>I go back to my point&mdash;the way in which clouds, as a matter
of fact, become visible. I have defined the floating or sky
cloud, and defined the falling, or earth cloud. But there's
a sort of thing between the two, which needs a third definition:
namely, Mist. In the 22d page of his 'Glaciers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the Alps,' Professor Tyndall says that "the marvelous blueness
of the sky in the earlier part of the day indicated that
the air was charged, almost to saturation, with transparent
aqueous vapor." Well, in certain weather that is true. You
all know the peculiar clearness which precedes rain,&mdash;when
the distant hills are looking nigh. I take it on trust from the
scientific people that there is then a quantity&mdash;almost to saturation&mdash;of
aqueous vapor in the air, but it is aqueous vapor
in a state which makes the air more transparent than it
would be without it. What state of aqueous molecule is that,
absolutely unreflective<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of light&mdash;perfectly transmissive of
light, and showing at once the color of blue water and blue air
on the distant hills?</p>

<p>I put the question&mdash;and pass round to the other side.
Such a clearness, though a certain forerunner of rain, is not
always its forerunner. Far the contrary. Thick air is a much
more frequent forerunner of rain than clear air. In cool
weather, you will often get the transparent prophecy: but in
hot weather, or in certain not hitherto defined states of atmosphere,
the forerunner of rain is mist. In a general way,
after you have had two or three days of rain, the air and sky
are healthily clear, and the sun bright. If it is hot also, the
next day is a little mistier&mdash;the next misty and sultry,&mdash;and
the next and the next, getting thicker and thicker&mdash;end in
another storm, or period of rain.</p>

<p>I suppose the thick air, as well as the transparent, is in
both cases saturated with aqueous vapor;&mdash;but also in both,
observe, vapor that floats everywhere, as if you mixed mud
with the sea; and it takes no shape anywhere: you may have
it with calm, or with wind, it makes no difference to it. You
have a nasty haze with a bitter east wind, or a nasty haze
with not a leaf stirring, and you may have the clear blue vapor
with a fresh rainy breeze, or the clear blue vapor as still
as the sky above. What difference is there between <i>these</i>
aqueous molecules that are clear, and those that are muddy,
<i>these</i> that must sink or rise, and those that must stay where
they are, <i>these</i> that have form and stature, that are bellied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11">[11]</a></span>
like whales and backed like weasels, and those that have
neither backs nor fronts, nor feet nor faces, but are a mist&mdash;and
no more&mdash;over two or three thousand square miles?</p>

<p>I again leave the questions with you, and pass on.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have spoken of all aqueous vapor as if it were
either transparent or white&mdash;visible by becoming opaque
like snow, but not by any accession of color. But even those
of us who are least observant of skies, know that, irrespective
of all supervening colors from the sun, there are white
clouds, brown clouds, gray clouds, and black clouds. Are
these indeed&mdash;what they appear to be&mdash;entirely distinct monastic
disciplines of cloud: Black Friars, and White Friars,
and Friars of Orders Gray? Or is it only their various nearness
to us, their denseness, and the failing of the light upon
them, that makes some clouds look black<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and others snowy?</p>

<p>I can only give you qualified and cautious answer. There
are, by differences in their own character, Dominican clouds,
and there are Franciscan;&mdash;there are the Black Hussars of
the Bandiera della Morte, and there are the Scots Grays
whose horses can run upon the rock. But if you ask me, as
I would have you ask me, why argent and why sable, how
baptized in white like a bride or a novice, and how hooded
with blackness like a Judge of the Vehmgericht Tribunal,&mdash;I
leave these questions with you, and pass on.</p>

<p>Admitting degrees of darkness, we have next to ask what
color, from sunshine can the white cloud receive, and what
the black?</p>

<p>You won't expect me to tell you all that, or even the little
that is accurately known about that, in a quarter of an hour;
yet note these main facts on the matter.</p>

<p>On any pure white, and practically opaque, cloud, or thing
like a cloud, as an Alp, or Milan Cathedral, you can have cast
by rising or setting sunlight, any tints of amber, orange, or
moderately deep rose&mdash;you can't have lemon yellows, or any
kind of green except in negative hue by opposition; and
though by stormlight you may sometimes get the reds cast
very deep, beyond a certain limit you cannot go,&mdash;the Alps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12">[12]</a></span>
are never vermilion color, nor flamingo color, nor canary
color; nor did you ever see a full scarlet cumulus of thundercloud.</p>

<p>On opaque white vapor, then, remember, you can get a glow
or a blush of color, never a flame of it.</p>

<p>But when the cloud is transparent as well as pure, and can
be filled with light through all the body of it, you then can
have by the light reflected<a name="FNanchor_14_16" id="FNanchor_14_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_16" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from its atoms any force conceivable
by human mind of the entire group of the golden and
ruby colors, from intensely burnished gold color, through a
scarlet for whose brightness there are no words, into any
depth and any hue of Tyrian crimson and Byzantine purple.
These with full blue breathed between them at the zenith, and
green blue nearer the horizon, form the scales and chords of
color possible to the morning and evening sky in pure and
fine weather; the keynote of the opposition being vermilion
against green blue, both of equal tone, and at such a height
and acme of brilliancy that you cannot see the line where
their edges pass into each other.</p>

<p>No colors that can be fixed in earth can ever represent to
you the luster of these cloudy ones. But the actual tints may
be shown you in a lower key, and to a certain extent their
power and relation to each other.</p>

<p>I have painted the diagram here shown you with colors
prepared for me lately by Messrs. Newman, which I find
brilliant to the height that pigments can be; and the ready
kindness of Mr. Wilson Barrett enables me to show you their
effect by a white light as pure as that of the day. The diagram
is enlarged from my careful sketch of the sunset of 1st
October, 1868, at Abbeville, which was a beautiful example of
what, in fine weather about to pass into storm, a sunset could
then be, in the districts of Kent and Picardy unaffected by
smoke. In reality, the ruby and vermilion clouds were, by
myriads, more numerous than I have had time to paint: but
the general character of their grouping is well enough expressed.
All the illumined clouds are high in the air, and
nearly motionless; beneath them, electric storm-cloud rises in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a threatening cumulus on the right, and drifts in dark flakes
across the horizon, casting from its broken masses radiating
shadows on the upper clouds. These shadows are traced, in
the first place by making the misty blue of the open sky more
transparent, and therefore darker; and secondly, by entirely
intercepting the sunbeams on the bars of cloud, which, within
the shadowed spaces, show dark on the blue instead of light.</p>

<p>But, mind, all that is done by reflected light&mdash;and in that
light you never get a <i>green</i> ray from the reflecting cloud;
there is no such thing in nature as a green lighted cloud relieved
from a red sky,&mdash;the cloud is always red, and the sky
green, and green, observe, by transmitted, not reflected light.</p>

<p>But now note, there is another kind of cloud, pure white,
and exquisitely delicate; which acts not by reflecting, nor by
refracting, but, as it is now called, <i>dif</i>fracting, the sun's
rays. The particles of this cloud are said&mdash;with what truth
I know not<a name="FNanchor_15_18" id="FNanchor_15_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_18" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;to send the sunbeams round them instead
of through them; somehow or other, at any rate, they resolve
them into their prismatic elements; and then you have literally
a kaleidoscope in the sky, with every color of the prism
in absolute purity; but above all in force, now, the ruby red
and the <i>green</i>,&mdash;with purple, and violet-blue, in a virtual
equality, more definite than that of the rainbow. The red
in the rainbow is mostly brick red, the violet, though beautiful,
often lost at the edge; but in the prismatic cloud the
violet, the green, and the ruby are all more lovely than in any
precious stones, and they are varied as in a bird's breast,
changing their places, depths, and extent at every instant.</p>

<p>The main cause of this change being, that the prismatic
cloud itself is always in rapid, and generally in fluctuating
motion. "A light veil of clouds had drawn itself," says Professor
Tyndall, in describing his solitary ascent of Monte
Rosa, "between me and the sun, and this was flooded with the
most brilliant dyes. Orange, red, green, blue&mdash;all the hues
produced by diffraction&mdash;were exhibited in the utmost splendor.</p>

<p>"Three times during my ascent (the short ascent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the last peak) similar veils drew themselves across the sun,
and at each passage the splendid phenomena were renewed.
There seemed a tendency to form circular zones of color
round the sun; but the clouds were not sufficiently uniform
to permit of this, and they were consequently broken into
spaces, each steeped with the color due to the condition of the
cloud at the place."</p>

<p>Three times, you observe, the veil passed, and three times
another came, or the first faded and another formed; and so
it is always, as far as I have registered prismatic cloud: and
the most beautiful colors I ever saw were on those that flew
fastest.</p>

<p>This second diagram is enlarged admirably by Mr. Arthur
Severn from my sketch of the sky in the afternoon of the 6th
of August, 1880, at Brantwood, two hours before sunset.
You are looking west by north, straight towards the sun, and
nearly straight towards the wind. From the west the wind
blows fiercely towards you out of the blue sky. Under the
blue space is a flattened dome of earth-cloud clinging to, and
altogether masking the form of, the mountain, known as the
Old Man of Coniston.</p>

<p>The top of that dome of cloud is two thousand eight hundred
feet above the sea, the mountain two thousand six
hundred, the cloud lying two hundred feet deep on it. Behind
it, westward and seaward, all's clear; but when the wind
out of that blue clearness comes over the ridge of the earth-cloud,
at that moment and that line, its own moisture congeals
into these white&mdash;I believe, <i>ice</i>-clouds; threads, and
meshes, and tresses, and tapestries, flying, failing, melting,
reappearing; spinning and unspinning themselves, coiling
and uncoiling, winding and unwinding, faster than eye or
thought can follow: and through all their dazzling maze of
frosty filaments shines a painted window in palpitation; its
pulses of color interwoven in motion, intermittent in fire,&mdash;emerald
and ruby and pale purple and violet melting into a
blue that is not of the sky, but of the sunbeam;&mdash;purer than
the crystal, softer than the rainbow, and brighter than the
snow.</p>

<p>But you must please here observe that while my first diagram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[15]</a></span>
did with some adequateness represent to you the color
facts there spoken of, the present diagram can only <i>explain</i>,
not reproduce them. The bright reflected colors of clouds
<i>can</i> be represented in painting, because they are relieved
against darker colors, or, in many cases, <i>are</i> dark colors, the
vermilion and ruby clouds being often much darker than the
green or blue sky beyond them. But in the case of the phenomena
now under your attention, the colors are all <i>brighter
than pure white</i>,&mdash;the entire body of the cloud in which they
show themselves being white by transmitted light, so that I
can only show you what the colors are, and where they are,&mdash;but
leaving them dark on the white ground. Only artificial,
and very high illumination would give the real effect of them,&mdash;painting
cannot.</p>

<p>Enough, however, is here done to fix in your minds the
distinction between those two species of cloud,&mdash;one, either
stationary,<a name="FNanchor_16_19" id="FNanchor_16_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_19" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or slow in motion, <i>reflecting unresolved</i> light;
the other, fast-flying, and <i>transmitting resolved</i> light. What
difference is there in the nature of the atoms, between those
two kinds of clouds? I leave the question with you for to-day,
merely hinting to you my suspicion that the prismatic
cloud is of finely-comminuted water, or ice,<a name="FNanchor_17_20" id="FNanchor_17_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_20" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> instead of aqueous
vapor; but the only clue I have to this idea is in the purity
of the rainbow formed in frost mist, lying close to water
surfaces. Such mist, however, only becomes prismatic as
common rain does, when the sun is behind the spectator,
while prismatic clouds are, on the contrary, always between
the spectator and the sun.</p>

<p>The main reason, however, why I can tell you nothing yet
about these colors of diffraction or interference, is that, whenever
I try to find anything firm for you to depend on, I am
stopped by the quite frightful inaccuracy of the scientific
people's terms, which is the consequence of their always trying
to write mixed Latin and English, so losing the grace of
the one and the sense of the other. And, in this point of the
diffraction of light I am stopped dead by their confusion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[16]</a></span>
idea also, in using the words undulation and vibration as
synonyms. "When," says Professor Tyndall, "you are told
that the atoms of the sun <i>vibrate</i> at different rates, and produce
<i>waves</i> of different sizes,&mdash;your experience of water-waves
will enable you to form a tolerably clear notion of what
is meant."</p>

<p>'Tolerably clear'!&mdash;your toleration must be considerable,
then. Do you suppose a water-wave is like a harp-string?
Vibration is the movement of a body in a state of tension,&mdash;undulation,
that of a body absolutely lax. In vibration, not
an atom of the body changes its place in relation to another,&mdash;in
undulation, not an atom of the body remains in the same
place with regard to another. In vibration, every particle
of the body ignores gravitation, or defies it,&mdash;in undulation,
every particle of the body is slavishly submitted to it. In
undulation, not one wave is like another; in vibration, every
pulse is alike. And of undulation itself, there are all manner
of visible conditions, which are not true conditions. A
flag ripples in the wind, but it does not undulate as the sea
does,&mdash;for in the sea, the water is taken from the trough to
put on to the ridge, but in the flag, though the motion is progressive,
the bits of bunting keep their place. You see a field
of corn undulating as if it was water,&mdash;it is different from
the flag, for the ears of corn bow out of their places and return
to them,&mdash;and yet, it is no more like the undulation of
the sea, than the shaking of an aspen leaf in a storm, or the
lowering of the lances in a battle.</p>

<p>And the best of the jest is, that after mixing up these two
notions in their heads inextricably, the scientific people apply
both when neither will fit; and when all undulation known to
us presumes weight, and all vibration, impact,&mdash;the undulating
theory of light is proposed to you concerning a medium
which you can neither weigh nor touch!</p>

<p>All <i>communicable</i> vibration&mdash;of course I mean&mdash;and in
dead matter: <i>You</i> may fall a shivering on your own account,
if you like, but you can't get a billiard-ball to fall a shivering
on <i>its</i> own account.<a name="FNanchor_18_22" id="FNanchor_18_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_22" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Yet observe that in thus signalizing the inaccuracy of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[17]</a></span>
terms in which they are taught, I neither accept, nor assail,
the conclusions respecting the oscillatory states of light, heat,
and sound, which have resulted from the postulate of an elastic,
though impalpable and imponderable ether, possessing
the elasticity of air. This only I desire you to mark with
attention,&mdash;that both light and sound are <i>sensations</i> of the animal
frame, which remain, and must remain, wholly inexplicable,
whatever manner of force, pulse, or palpitation may
be instrumental in producing them: nor does any such force
<i>become</i> light or sound, except in its rencontre with an animal.
The leaf hears no murmur in the wind to which it wavers on
the branches, nor can the clay discern the vibration by which
it is thrilled into a ruby. The Eye and the Ear are the
creators alike of the ray and the tone; and the conclusion
follows logically from the right conception of their living
power,&mdash;"He that planted the Ear, shall He not hear? He
that formed the Eye, shall not He see?"</p>

<p>For security, therefore, and simplicity of definition of
light, you will find no possibility of advancing beyond Plato's
"the power that through the eye manifests color," but on
that definition, you will find, alike by Plato and all great
subsequent thinkers, a <i>moral</i> Science of Light founded, far
and away more important to you than all the physical laws
ever learned by vitreous revelation. Concerning which I
will refer you to the sixth lecture which I gave at Oxford in
1872, on the relation of Art to the Science of Light ('The
Eagle's Nest'), reading now only the sentence introducing its
subject:&mdash;"The 'Fiat lux' of creation is therefore, in the
deep sense, 'fiat anima,' and is as much, when you understand
it, the ordering of Intelligence as the ordering of Vision.
It is the appointment of change of what had been else
only a mechanical effluence from things unseen to things unseeing,&mdash;from
Stars, that did not shine, to Earth, that did not
perceive,&mdash;the change, I say, of that blind vibration into
the glory of the Sun and Moon for human eyes: so making
possible the communication out of the unfathomable truth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that portion of truth which is good for us, and animating to
us, and is set to rule over the day and over the night of our
joy and our sorrow."</p>

<p>Returning now to our subject at the point from which I
permitted myself, I trust not without your pardon, to diverge;
you may incidentally, but carefully, observe, that the
effect of such a sky as that represented in the second diagram,
so far as it can be abstracted or conveyed by painting at all,
implies the total absence of any pervading warmth of tint,
such as artists usually call 'tone.' Every tint must be the
purest possible, and above all the white. Partly, lest you
should think, from my treatment of these two phases of effect,
that I am insensible to the quality of tone,&mdash;and partly to
complete the representation of states of weather undefiled by
plague-cloud, yet capable of the most solemn dignity in saddening
color, I show you, Diagram 3, the record of an autumn
twilight of the year 1845,&mdash;sketched while I was changing
horses between Verona and Brescia. The distant sky in
this drawing is in the glowing calm which is always taken
by the great Italian painters for the background of their
sacred pictures; a broad field of cloud is advancing upon it
overhead, and meeting others enlarging in the distance; these
are rain-clouds, which will certainly close over the clear sky,
and bring on rain before midnight: but there is no power in
them to pollute the sky beyond and above them: they do not
darken the air, nor defile it, nor in any way mingle with it;
their edges are burnished by the sun like the edges of golden
shields, and their advancing march is as deliberate and majestic
as the fading of the twilight itself into a darkness full
of stars.</p>

<p>These three instances are all I have time to give of the
former conditions of serene weather, and of non-electric rain-cloud.
But I must yet, to complete the sequence of my subject,
show you one example of a good, old-fashioned, healthy,
and mighty, storm.</p>

<p>In Diagram 4, Mr. Severn has beautifully enlarged my
sketch of a July thundercloud of the year 1858, on the Alps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the Val d'Aosta, seen from Turin, that is to say, some
twenty-five or thirty miles distant. You see that no mistake
is possible here about what is good weather and what
bad, or which is cloud and which is sky; but I show you this
sketch especially to give you the scale of heights for such
clouds in the atmosphere. These thunder cumuli entirely
<i>hide</i> the higher Alps. It does not, however, follow that they
have buried them, for most of their own aspect of height is
owing to the approach of their nearer masses; but at all
events, you have cumulus there rising from its base, at about
three thousand feet above the plain, to a good ten thousand
in the air.</p>

<p>White cirri, in reality parallel, but by perspective radiating,
catch the sunshine above, at a height of from fifteen to
twenty thousand feet; but the storm on the mountains gathers
itself into a full mile's depth of massy cloud, every fold of
it involved with thunder, but every form of it, every action,
every color, magnificent:&mdash;doing its mighty work in its own
hour and its own dominion, nor snatching from you for an
instant, nor defiling with a stain, the abiding blue of the
transcendent sky, or the fretted silver of its passionless
clouds.</p>

<p>We so rarely now see cumulus cloud of this grand kind,
that I will yet delay you by reading the description of its
nearer aspect, in the 'Eagle's Nest.'</p>

<p>"The rain which flooded our fields the Sunday before last,
was followed, as you will remember, by bright days, of which
Tuesday the 20th (February, 1872) was, in London, notable
for the splendor, towards the afternoon, of its white cumulus
clouds. There has been so much black east wind lately, and
so much fog and artificial gloom, besides, that I find it is
actually some two years since I last saw a noble cumulus
cloud under full light. I chanced to be standing under the
Victoria Tower at Westminster, when the largest mass of
them floated past, that day, from the northwest; and I was
more impressed than ever yet by the awfulness of the cloud-form,
and its unaccountableness, in the present state of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[20]</a></span>
knowledge. The Victoria Tower, seen against it, had no
magnitude: it was like looking at Mont Blanc over a lamp-post.
The domes of cloud-snow were heaped as definitely:
their broken flanks were as gray and firm as rocks, and the
whole mountain, of a compass and height in heaven which
only became more and more inconceivable as the eye strove to
ascend it, was passing behind the tower with a steady march,
whose swiftness must in reality have been that of a tempest:
yet, along all the ravines of vapor, precipice kept pace with
precipice, and not one thrust another.</p>

<p>"What is it that hews them out? Why is the blue sky
pure there,&mdash;the cloud solid here; and edged like marble: and
why does the state of the blue sky pass into the state of cloud,
in that calm advance?</p>

<p>"It is true that you can more or less imitate the forms of
cloud with explosive vapor or steam; but the steam melts
instantly, and the explosive vapor dissipates itself. The
cloud, of perfect form, proceeds unchanged. It is not an
explosion, but an enduring and advancing presence. The
more you think of it, the less explicable it will become to
you."</p>

<p>Thus far then of clouds that were once familiar; now at
last, entering on my immediate subject, I shall best introduce
it to you by reading an entry in my diary which gives progressive
description of the most gentle aspect of the modern
plague-cloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="quotdate">
"<i>Bolton Abbey, 4th July, 1875.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Half-past eight, morning; the first bright morning for
the last fortnight.</p>

<p>At half-past five it was entirely clear, and entirely calm;
the moorlands glowing, and the Wharfe glittering in sacred
light, and even the thin-stemmed field-flowers quiet as stars,
in the peace in which&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All trees and simples, great and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That balmy leaf do bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than they were painted on a wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more do move, nor steir.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>But, an hour ago, the leaves at my window first shook
slightly. They are now trembling <i>continuously</i>, as those of
all the trees, under a gradually rising wind, of which the
tremulous action scarcely permits the direction to be defined,&mdash;but
which falls and returns in fits of varying force, like
those which precede a thunderstorm&mdash;never wholly ceasing:
the direction of its upper current is shown by a few ragged
white clouds, moving fast from the north, which rose, at the
time of the first leaf-shaking, behind the edge of the moors in
the east.</p>

<p>This wind is the plague-wind of the eighth decade of years
in the nineteenth century; a period which will assuredly be
recognized in future meteorological history as one of phenomena
hitherto unrecorded in the courses of nature, and characterized
pre-eminently by the almost ceaseless action of this
calamitous wind. While I have been writing these sentences,
the white clouds above specified have increased to twice
the size they had when I began to write; and in about two
hours from this time&mdash;say by eleven o'clock, if the wind continue,&mdash;the
whole sky will be dark with them, as it was yesterday,
and has been through prolonged periods during the
last five years. I first noticed the definite character of this
wind, and of the clouds it brings with it, in the year 1871,
describing it then in the July number of 'Fors Clavigera';
but little, at that time, apprehending either its universality, or
any probability of its annual continuance. I am able now to
state positively that its range of power extends from the
North of England to Sicily; and that it blows more or less
during the whole of the year, except the early autumn. This
autumnal abdication is, I hope, beginning: it blew but feebly
yesterday, though without intermission, from the north, making
every shady place cold, while the sun was burning; its
effect on the sky being only to dim the blue of it between
masses of ragged cumulus. To-day it has entirely fallen;
and there seems hope of bright weather, the first for me since
the end of May, when I had two fine days at Aylesbury; the
third, May 28th, being black again from morning to evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[22]</a></span>
There seems to be some reference to the blackness caused by
the prevalence of this wind in the old French name of Bise,
'<i>gray</i> wind'; and, indeed, one of the darkest and bitterest
days of it I ever saw was at Vevay in 1872."</p>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The first time I recognized the clouds brought by the
plague-wind as distinct in character was in walking back
from Oxford, after a hard day's work, to Abingdon, in the
early spring of 1871: it would take too long to give you any
account this evening of the particulars which drew my attention
to them; but during the following months I had too
frequent opportunities of verifying my first thoughts of them,
and on the first of July in that year wrote the description of
them which begins the 'Fors Clavigera' of August, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the first of July, and I sit down to write by the dismalest
light that ever yet I wrote by; namely, the light of this
midsummer morning, in mid-England, (Matlock, Derbyshire),
in the year 1871.</p>

<p>"For the sky is covered with gray cloud;&mdash;not rain-cloud,
but a dry black veil, which no ray of sunshine can pierce;
partly diffused in mist, feeble mist, enough to make distant
objects unintelligible, yet without any substance, or wreathing,
or color of its own. And everywhere the leaves of the
trees are shaking fitfully, as they do before a thunder-storm;
only not violently, but enough to show the passing to and fro
of a strange, bitter, blighting wind. Dismal enough, had it
been the first morning of its kind that summer had sent.
But during all this spring, in London, and at Oxford, through
meager March, through changelessly sullen April, through
despondent May, and darkened June, morning after morning
has come gray-shrouded thus.</p>

<p>"And it is a new thing to me, and a very dreadful one. I
am fifty years old, and more; and since I was five, have
gleaned the best hours of my life in the sun of spring and
summer mornings; and I never saw such as these, till now.</p>

<p>"And the scientific men are busy as ants, examining the
sun, and the moon, and the seven stars, and can tell me all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[23]</a></span>
about <i>them</i>, I believe, by this time; and how they move, and
what they are made of.</p>

<p>"And I do not care, for my part, two copper spangles how
they move, nor what they are made of. I can't move them
any other way than they go, nor make them of anything else,
better than they are made. But I would care much and give
much, if I could be told where this bitter wind comes from,
and what <i>it</i> is made of.</p>

<p>"For, perhaps, with forethought, and fine laboratory
science, one might make it of something else.</p>

<p>"It looks partly as if it were made of poisonous smoke;
very possibly it may be: there are at least two hundred
furnace chimneys in a square of two miles on every side of
me. But mere smoke would not blow to and fro in that wild
way. It looks more to me as if it were made of dead men's
souls&mdash;such of them as are not gone yet where they have to
go, and may be flitting hither and thither, doubting, themselves,
of the fittest place for them.</p>

<p>"You know, if there <i>are</i> such things as souls, and if ever
any of them haunt places where they have been hurt, there
must be many about us, just now, displeased enough!"</p>

<p>The last sentence refers of course to the battles of the
Franco-German campaign, which was especially horrible to
me, in its digging, as the Germans should have known, a
moat flooded with waters of death between the two nations for
a century to come.</p>

<p>Since that Midsummer day, my attention, however otherwise
occupied, has never relaxed in its record of the phenomena
characteristic of the plague-wind; and I now define for
you, as briefly as possible, the essential signs of it.</p>

<p>1. It is a wind of darkness,&mdash;all the former conditions of
tormenting winds, whether from the north or east were more
or less capable of co-existing with sunlight, and often with
steady and bright sunlight; but whenever, and wherever the
plague-wind blows, be it but for ten minutes, the sky is darkened
instantly.</p>

<p>2. It is a malignant <i>quality</i> of wind, unconnected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[24]</a></span>
any one quarter of the compass; it blows indifferently from
all, attaching its own bitterness and malice to the worst characters
of the proper winds of each quarter. It will blow
either with drenching rain, or dry rage, from the south,&mdash;with
ruinous blasts from the west,&mdash;with bitterest chills
from the north,&mdash;and with venomous blight from the east.</p>

<p>Its own favorite quarter, however, is the southwest, so that
it is distinguished in its malignity equally from the Bise of
Provence, which is a north wind always, and from our own
old friend, the east.</p>

<p>3. It always blows <i>tremulously</i>, making the leaves of the
trees shudder as if they were all aspens, but with a peculiar
fitfulness which gives them&mdash;and I watch them this moment
as I write&mdash;an expression of anger as well as of fear and distress.
You may see the kind of quivering, and hear the ominous
whimpering, in the gusts that precede a great thunderstorm;
but plague-wind is more panic-struck, and feverish;
and its sound is a hiss instead of a wail.</p>

<p>When I was last at Avallon, in South France, I went to see
'Faust' played at the little country theater: it was done with
scarcely any means of pictorial effect, except a few old curtains,
and a blue light or two. But the night on the Brocken
was nevertheless extremely appalling to me,&mdash;a strange
ghastliness being obtained in some of the witch scenes merely
by fine management of gesture and drapery; and in the phantom
scenes, by the half-palsied, half-furious, faltering or
fluttering past of phantoms stumbling as into graves; as if of
not only soulless, but senseless, Dead, moving with the very
action, the rage, the decrepitude, and the trembling of the
plague-wind.</p>

<p>4. Not only tremulous at every moment, it is also <i>intermittent</i>
with a rapidity quite unexampled in former
weather. There are, indeed, days&mdash;and weeks, on which it
blows without cessation, and is as inevitable as the Gulf
Stream; but also there are days when it is contending with
healthy weather, and on such days it will remit for half an
hour, and the sun will begin to show itself, and then the wind
will come back and cover the whole sky with clouds in ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25">[25]</a></span>
minutes; and so on, every half-hour, through the whole day;
so that it is often impossible to go on with any kind of drawing
in color, the light being never for two seconds the same
from morning till evening.</p>

<p>5. It degrades, while it intensifies, ordinary storm; but
before I read you any description of its efforts in this kind, I
must correct an impression which has got abroad through the
papers, that I speak as if the plague-wind blew now always,
and there were no more any natural weather. On the contrary,
the winter of 1878-9 was one of the most healthy and
lovely I ever saw ice in;&mdash;Coniston lake shone under the
calm clear frost in one marble field, as strong as the floor of
Milan Cathedral, half a mile across and four miles down;
and the first entries in my diary which I read you shall be
from the 22d to 26th June, 1876, of perfectly lovely and
natural weather.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
"<i>Sunday, 25th June, 1876.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday, an entirely glorious sunset, unmatched in
beauty since that at Abbeville,&mdash;deep scarlet, and purest
rose, on purple gray, in bars; and stationary, plumy, sweeping
filaments above in upper sky, like '<i>using up the brush</i>,'
said Joanie; remaining in glory, every moment best, changing
from one good into another, (but only in color or light&mdash;<i>form
steady</i>,) for half an hour full, and the clouds afterwards
fading into the gray against amber twilight, <i>stationary in the
same form for about two hours</i>, at least. The darkening
rose tint remained till half-past ten, the grand time being at
nine.</p>

<p>The day had been fine,&mdash;exquisite green light on afternoon
hills.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
<i>Monday, 26th June, 1876.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday an entirely perfect summer light on the Old
Man; Lancaster Bay all clear; Ingleborough and the great
Pennine fault as on a map. Divine beauty of western color
on thyme and rose,&mdash;then twilight of clearest <i>warm</i> amber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[26]</a></span>
far into night, of <i>pale</i> amber all night long; hills dark-clear
against it.</p>

<p>And so it continued, only growing more intense in blue
and sunlight, all day. After breakfast, I came in from the
well under strawberry bed, to say I had never seen anything
like it, so pure or intense, in Italy; and so it went glowing
on, cloudless, with soft north wind, all day.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
<i>16th July.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The sunset almost too bright <i>through the blinds</i> for me
to read Humboldt at tea by,&mdash;finally, new moon like a lime-light,
reflected on breeze-struck water; traces, across dark
calm, of reflected hills."</p></div>

<p>These extracts are, I hope, enough to guard you against the
absurdity of supposing that it all only means that I am myself
soured, or doting, in my old age, and always in an ill
humor. Depend upon it, when old men are worth anything,
they are better humored than young ones; and have learned
to see what good there is, and pleasantness, in the world they
are likely so soon to have orders to quit.</p>

<p>Now then&mdash;take the following sequences of accurate description
of thunderstorm, <i>with</i> plague-wind.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
<i>"22d June, 1876.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Thunderstorm; pitch dark, with no <i>blackness</i>,&mdash;but deep,
high, <i>filthiness</i> of lurid, yet not sublimely lurid, smoke-cloud;
dense manufacturing mist; fearful squalls of shivery
wind, making Mr. Severn's sail quiver like a man in a fever
fit&mdash;all about four, afternoon&mdash;but only two or three claps of
thunder, and feeble, though near, flashes. I never saw such
a dirty, weak, foul storm. It cleared suddenly, after raining
all afternoon, at half-past eight to nine, into pure, natural
weather,&mdash;low rain-clouds on quite clear, green, wet hills.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
<i>Brantwood, 13th August, 1879.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The most terrific and horrible thunderstorm, this morning,
I ever remember. It waked me at six, or a little before&mdash;then
rolling incessantly, like railway luggage trains, quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ghastly in its mockery of them&mdash;the air one loathsome mass
of sultry and foul fog, like smoke; scarcely raining at all, but
increasing to heavier rollings, with flashes quivering vaguely
through all the air, and at last terrific double streams of reddish-violet
fire, not forked or zigzag, but rippled rivulets&mdash;two
at the same instant some twenty to thirty degrees apart,
and lasting on the eye at least half a second, with grand artillery-peals
following; not rattling crashes, or irregular
cracklings, but delivered volleys. It lasted an hour, then
passed off, clearing a little, without rain to speak of,&mdash;not a
glimpse of blue,&mdash;and now, half-past seven, seems settling
down again into Manchester devil's darkness.</p>

<p>Quarter to eight, morning.&mdash;Thunder returned, all the air
collapsed into one black fog, the hills invisible, and scarcely
visible the opposite shore; heavy rain in short fits, and frequent,
though less formidable, flashes, and shorter thunder.
While I have written this sentence the cloud has again dissolved
itself, like a nasty solution in a bottle, with miraculous
and unnatural rapidity, and the hills are in sight again;
a double-forked flash&mdash;rippled, I mean, like the others&mdash;starts
into its frightful ladder of light between me and
Wetherlam, as I raise my eyes. All black above, a rugged
spray cloud on the Eaglet. (The 'Eaglet' is my own name
for the bold and elevated crag to the west of the little lake
above Coniston mines. It had no name among the country
people, and is one of the most conspicuous features of the
mountain chain, as seen from Brantwood.)</p>

<p>Half-past eight.&mdash;Three times light and three times dark
since last I wrote, and the darkness seeming each time as it
settles more loathsome, at last stopping my reading in mere
blindness. One lurid gleam of white cumulus in upper
lead-blue sky, seen for half a minute through the sulphurous
chimney-pot vomit of blackguardly cloud beneath, where its
rags were thinnest.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
<i>Thursday, 22d Feb. 1883.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday a fearfully dark mist all afternoon, with steady,
south plague-wind of the bitterest, nastiest, poisonous blight,
and fretful flutter. I could scarcely stay in the wood for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the horror of it. To-day, really rather bright blue, and
bright semi-cumuli, with the frantic Old Man blowing
sheaves of lancets and chisels across the lake&mdash;not in strength
enough, or whirl enough, to raise it in spray, but tracing
every squall's outline in black on the silver gray waves, and
whistling meanly, and as if on a flute made of a file.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
<i>Sunday, 17th August, 1879.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Raining in foul drizzle, slow and steady; sky pitch-dark,
and I just get a little light by sitting in the bow-window;
diabolic clouds over everything: and looking over my kitchen
garden yesterday, I found it one miserable mass of weeds
gone to seed, the roses in the higher garden putrefied into
brown sponges, feeling like dead snails; and the half-ripe
strawberries all rotten at the stalks."</p></div>

<p>6. And now I come to the most important sign of the
plague-wind and the plague-cloud: that in bringing on their
peculiar darkness, they <i>blanch</i> the sun instead of reddening
it. And here I must note briefly to you the uselessness of
observation by instruments, or machines, instead of eyes. In
the first year when I had begun to notice the specialty of the
plague-wind, I went of course to the Oxford observatory to
consult its registrars. They have their anemometer always
on the twirl, and can tell you the force, or at least the pace, of
a gale,<a name="FNanchor_19_23" id="FNanchor_19_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_23" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> by day or night. But the anemometer can only
record for you how often it has been driven round, not at all
whether it went round <i>steadily</i>, or went round <i>trembling</i>.
And on that point depends the entire question whether it is a
plague breeze or a healthy one: and what's the use of telling
you whether the wind's strong or not, when it can't tell you
whether it's a strong medicine, or a strong poison?</p>

<p>But again&mdash;you have your <i>sun</i>-measure, and can tell exactly
at any moment how strong, or how weak, or how wanting,
the sun is. But the sun-measurer can't tell you whether
the rays are stopped by a dense <i>shallow</i> cloud, or a thin <i>deep</i>
one. In healthy weather, the sun is hidden behind a cloud, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it is behind a tree; and, when the cloud is past, it comes out
again, as bright as before. But in plague-wind, the sun is
choked out of the whole heaven, all day long, by a cloud which
may be a thousand miles square and five miles deep.</p>

<p>And yet observe: that thin, scraggy, filthy, mangy, miserable
cloud, for all the depth of it, can't turn the sun red, as a
good, business-like fog does with a hundred feet or so of
itself. By the plague-wind every breath of air you draw is
polluted, half round the world; in a London fog the air
itself is pure, though you choose to mix up dirt with it, and
choke yourself with your own nastiness.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to show you a diagram of a sunset in
entirely pure weather, above London smoke. I saw it and
sketched it from my old post of observation&mdash;the top garret of
my father's house at Herne Hill. There, when the wind is
south, we are outside of the smoke and above it; and this
diagram, admirably enlarged from my own drawing by my,
now in all things best aide-de-camp, Mr. Collingwood, shows
you an old-fashioned sunset&mdash;the sort of thing Turner and
I used to have to look at,&mdash;(nobody else ever would) constantly.
Every sunset and every dawn, in fine weather,
had something of the sort to show us. This is one of the
last pure sunsets I ever saw, about the year 1876,&mdash;and the
point I want you to note in it is, that the air being pure,
the smoke on the horizon, though at last it hides the sun, yet
hides it through gold and vermilion. Now, don't go away
fancying there's any exaggeration in that study. The <i>prismatic</i>
colors, I told you, were simply impossible to paint;
these, which are transmitted colors, can indeed be suggested,
but no more. The brightest pigment we have would look dim
beside the truth.</p>

<p>I should have liked to have blotted down for you a bit of
plague-cloud to put beside this; but Heaven knows, you can
see enough of it now-a-days without any trouble of mine; and
if you want, in a hurry, to see what the sun looks like
through it, you've only to throw a bad half-crown into a basin
of soap and water.</p>

<p>Blanched Sun,&mdash;blighted grass,&mdash;blinded man.&mdash;If, in conclusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30">[30]</a></span>
you ask me for any conceivable cause or meaning of
these things&mdash;I can tell you none, according to your modern
beliefs; but I can tell you what meaning it would have borne
to the men of old time. Remember, for the last twenty years,
England, and all foreign nations, either tempting her, or following
her, have blasphemed<a name="FNanchor_20_27" id="FNanchor_20_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_27" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the name of God deliberately
and openly; and have done iniquity by proclamation, every
man doing as much injustice to his brother as it is in his
power to do. Of states in such moral gloom every seer of
old predicted the physical gloom, saying, "The light shall
be darkened in the heavens thereof, and the stars shall withdraw
their shining." All Greek, all Christian, all Jewish
prophecy insists on the same truth through a thousand myths;
but of all the chief, to former thought, was the fable of the
Jewish warrior and prophet, for whom the sun hasted not to
go down, with which I leave you to compare at leisure the
physical result of your own wars and prophecies, as declared
by your own elect journal not fourteen days ago,&mdash;that the
Empire of England, on which formerly the sun never set,
has become one on which he never rises.</p>

<p>What is best to be done, do you ask me? The answer is
plain. Whether you can affect the signs of the sky or not,
you <i>can</i> the signs of the times. Whether you can bring the
<i>sun</i> back or not, you can assuredly bring back your own cheerfulness,
and your own honesty. You may not be able to say
to the winds, "Peace; be still," but you can cease from the
insolence of your own lips, and the troubling of your own
passions. And all <i>that</i> it would be extremely well to do,
even though the day <i>were</i> coming when the sun should be as
darkness, and the moon as blood. But, the paths of rectitude
and piety once regained, who shall say that the promise of
old time would not be found to hold for us also?&mdash;"Bring
ye all the tithes into my storehouse, and prove me now herewith,
saith the Lord God, if I will not open you the windows
of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not
be room enough to receive it."</p>

<h2>LECTURE II.</h2>

<p class="quotdate">
<i>March 11th, 1884.</i><br />
</p>


<p>It was impossible for me, this spring, to prepare, as I
wished to have done, two lectures for the London Institution:
but finding its members more interested in the subject chosen
than I had anticipated, I enlarged my lecture at its second
reading by some explanations and parentheses, partly represented,
and partly farther developed, in the following notes;
which led me on, however, as I arranged them, into branches
of the subject untouched in the former lecture, and it seems
to me of no inferior interest.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>
<a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The vapor over the pool of Anger in the 'Inferno,' the
clogging stench which rises from Caina, and the fog of the
circle of Anger in the 'Purgatorio' resemble, indeed, the
cloud of the Plague-wind very closely,&mdash;but are conceived
only as supernatural. The reader will no doubt observe,
throughout the following lecture, my own habit of speaking of
beautiful things as 'natural,' and of ugly ones as 'unnatural.'
In the conception of recent philosophy, the world is one Kosmos
in which diphtheria is held to be as natural as song,
and cholera as digestion. To my own mind, and the more
distinctly the more I see, know, and feel, the Earth, as prepared
for the abode of man, appears distinctly ruled by
agencies of health and disease, of which the first may be
aided by his industry, prudence, and piety; while the destroying
laws are allowed to prevail against him, in the degree in
which he allows himself in idleness, folly, and vice. Had
the point been distinctly indicated where the degrees of adversity
necessary for his discipline pass into those intended
for his punishment, the world would have been put under a
manifest theocracy; but the declaration of the principle is at
least distinct enough to have convinced all sensitive and
earnest persons, from the beginning of speculation in the eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and mind of Man: and it has been put in my power by one
of the singular chances which have always helped me in my
work when it was in the right direction, to present to the
University of Oxford the most distinct expression of this
first principle of medi&aelig;val Theology which, so far as I know,
exists in fifteenth-century art. It is one of the drawings of
the Florentine book which I bought for a thousand pounds,
against the British Museum, some ten or twelve years since;
being a compendium of classic and medi&aelig;val religious symbolism.
In the two pages of it, forming one picture, given to
Oxford, the delivery of the Law on Sinai is represented on
the left hand, (<i>contrary to the Scriptural narrative</i>, but in
deeper expression of the benediction of the Sacred Law to all
nations,) as in the midst of bright and calm light, the figure
of the Deity being supported by luminous and level clouds,
and attended by happy angels: while opposite, on the right
hand, the worship of the Golden Calf is symbolized by a
single decorated pillar, with the calf on its summit, surrounded
by the clouds and darkness of a furious storm, issuing
from the mouths of fiends;&mdash;uprooting the trees, and
throwing down the rocks, above the broken tables of the Law,
of which the fragments lie in the foreground.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> These conditions are mainly in the arrangement of the
lower rain-clouds in flakes thin and detached enough to be
illuminated by early or late sunbeams: their textures are
then more softly blended than those of the upper cirri, and
have the qualities of painted, instead of burnished or inflamed,
color.
</p><p>
They were thus described in the 4th chapter of the 7th
part of 'Modern Painters':&mdash;
</p><p>
"Often in our English mornings, the rain-clouds in the
dawn form soft level fields, which melt imperceptibly into
the blue; or when of less extent, gather into apparent bars,
crossing the sheets of broader cloud above; and all these
bathed throughout in an unspeakable light of pure rose-color,
and purple, and amber, and blue, not shining, but misty-soft,
the barred masses, when seen nearer, found to be woven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in tresses of cloud, like floss silk, looking as if each knot
were a little swathe or sheaf of lighted rain.
</p><p>
"No clouds form such skies, none are so tender, various,
inimitable; Turner himself never caught them. Correggio,
putting out his whole strength, could have painted them,&mdash;no
other man."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I did not, in writing this sentence, forget Mr. Gladstone's
finely scholastic enthusiasm for Homer; nor Mr.
Newton's for Athenian&mdash;(I wish it had not been also for
Halicarnassian) sculpture. But Byron loved Greece herself&mdash;through
her death&mdash;and <i>to</i> his own; while the subsequent
refusal of England to give Greece one of our own princes for
a king, has always been held by me the most ignoble,
cowardly, and lamentable, of all our base commercial <i>im</i>policies.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> 'Deepening' clouds.&mdash;Byron never uses an epithet
vainly,&mdash;he is the most accurate, and therefore the most
powerful, of all modern describers. The deepening of the
cloud is essentially necessary to the redness of the orb.
Ordinary observers are continually unaware of this fact,
and imagine that a red sun can be darker than the sky
round it! Thus Mr. Gould, though a professed naturalist,
and passing most of his life in the open air, over and over
again, in his 'British Birds,' draws the setting sun dark on
the sky!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> 'Like the blood he predicts.'&mdash;The astrological power of
the planet Mars was of course ascribed to it in the same connection
with its red color. The reader may be interested to
see the notice, in 'Modern Painters,' of Turner's constant
use of the same symbol; partly an expression of his own
personal feeling, partly, the employment of a symbolic language
known to all careful readers of solar and stellar
tradition.
</p><p>
"He was very definitely in the habit of indicating the
association of any subject with circumstances of death,
especially the death of multitudes, by placing it under one
of his most deeply <i>crimsoned</i> sunset skies.
</p><p>
"The color of blood is thus plainly taken for the leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[34]</a></span>
tone in the storm-clouds above the 'Slave-ship.' It occurs
with similar distinctness in the much earlier picture of
'Ulysses and Polypheme,' in that of 'Napoleon at St.
Helena,' and, subdued by softer hues, in the 'Old T&eacute;m&eacute;raire.'
</p><p>
"The sky of this Goldau is, in its scarlet and crimson, the
deepest in tone of all that I know in Turner's drawings.
</p><p>
"Another feeling, traceable in several of his former works,
is an acute sense of the contrast between the careless interests
and idle pleasures of daily life, and the state of those whose
time for labor, or knowledge, or delight, is passed forever.
There is evidence of this feeling in the introduction of the
boys at play in the churchyard of Kirkby Lonsdale, and the
boy climbing for his kite among the thickets above the little
mountain churchyard of Brignal-bank; it is in the same tone
of thought that he has placed here the two figures fishing,
leaning against these shattered flanks of rock,&mdash;the sepulchral
stones of the great mountain Field of Death."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> 'Thy lore unto calamity.'&mdash;It is, I believe, recognized
by all who have in any degree become interested in the
traditions of Chaldean astrology, that its warnings were distinct,&mdash;its
promises deceitful. Horace thus warns Leuconoe
against reading the Babylonian numbers to learn the time of
her death,&mdash;he does not imply their promise of previous
happiness; and the continually deceptive character of the
Delphic oracle itself, tempted always rather to fatal than to
fortunate conduct, unless the inquirer were more than wise in
his reading. Byron gathers into the bitter question all the
sorrow of former superstition, while in the lines italicized,
just above, he sums in the briefest and plainest English, all
that we yet know, or may wisely think, about the Sun. It is
the '<i>Burning</i> oracle' (other oracles there are by sound, or
feeling, but this by fire) of all that lives; the only means of
our accurate knowledge of the things round us, and that
affect our lives: it is the <i>fountain</i> of all life,&mdash;Byron does
not say the <i>origin</i>;&mdash;the origin of life would be the origin of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the sun itself; but it is the visible <i>source</i> of vital energy, as
the spring is of a stream, though the origin is the sea. "And
symbol of Him who bestows it."&mdash;This the sun has always
been, to every one who believes there is a bestower; and a
symbol so perfect and beautiful that it may also be thought
of as partly an apocalypse.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> 'More beautiful in that variety.'&mdash;This line, with the
one italicized beneath, expresses in Myrrha's mind, the feeling
which I said, in the outset, every thoughtful watcher of
heaven necessarily had in those old days; whereas now, the
variety is for the most part, only in modes of disagreeableness;
and the vapor, instead of adding light to the unclouded
sky, takes away the aspect and destroys the functions of sky
altogether.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> 'Steam out of an engine funnel.'&mdash;Compare the sixth
paragraph of Professor Tyndall's 'Forms of Water,' and the
following seventh one, in which the phenomenon of transparent
steam becoming opaque is thus explained. "Every
bit of steam shrinks, when chilled, to a much more minute
particle of water. The liquid particles thus produced form
a kind of water dust of exceeding fineness, which floats in
the air, and is called a cloud."
</p><p>
But the author does not tell us, in the first place, what is
the shape or nature of a 'bit of steam,' nor, in the second
place, how the contraction of the individual bits of steam is
effected without any diminution of the whole mass of them,
but on the contrary, during its steady <i>expansion</i>; in the
third place he assumes that the particles of water dust are
solid, not vesicular, which is not yet ascertained; in the
fourth place, he does not tell us how their number and size
are related to the quantity of invisible moisture in the air; in
the fifth place, he does not tell us how cool invisible moisture
differs from hot invisible moisture; and in the sixth, he does
not tell us why the cool visible moisture stays while the hot
visible moisture melts away. So much for the present state
of 'scientific' information, or at least communicativeness, on
the first and simplest conditions of the problem before us!
</p><p>
In its wider range that problem embraces the total mystery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of volatile power in substance; and of the visible states consequent
on sudden&mdash;and presumably, therefore, imperfect&mdash;vaporization;
as the smoke of frankincense, or the sacred
fume of modern devotion which now fills the inhabited
world, as that of the rose and violet its deserts. What,&mdash;it
would be useful to know, is the actual bulk of an atom of
orange perfume?&mdash;what of one of vaporized tobacco, or gunpowder?&mdash;and
where do <i>these</i> artificial vapors fall back in
beneficent rain? or through what areas of atmosphere exist,
as invisible, though perhaps not innocuous, cloud?
</p><p>
All these questions were put, closely and precisely, four-and-twenty
years ago, in the 1st chapter of the 7th part of
'Modern Painters,' paragraphs 4 to 9, of which I can here
allow space only for the last, which expresses the final difficulties
of the matter better than anything said in this lecture:&mdash;
</p><p>
"But farther: these questions of volatility, and visibility,
and hue, are all complicated with those of shape. How is a
cloud outlined? Granted whatever you choose to ask, concerning
its material, or its aspect, its loftiness and luminousness,&mdash;how
of its limitation? What hews it into a heap,
or spins it into a web? Cold is usually shapeless, I suppose,
extending over large spaces equally, or with gradual diminution.
You cannot have in the open air, angles, and
wedges, and coils, and cliffs, of cold. Yet the vapor stops
suddenly, sharp and steep as a rock, or thrusts itself across the
gates of heaven in likeness of a brazen bar; or braids itself
in and out, and across and across, like a tissue of tapestry;
or falls into ripples, like sand; or into waving shreds and
tongues, as fire. On what anvils and wheels is the vapor
pointed, twisted, hammered, whirled, as the potter's clay?
By what hands is the incense of the sea built up into domes
of marble?"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The opposed conditions of the higher and lower orders
of cloud, with the balanced intermediate one, are beautifully
seen on mountain summits of rock or earth. On snowy ones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37">[37]</a></span>
they are far more complex: but on rock summits there are
three distinct forms of attached cloud in serene weather; the
first that of cloud veil laid over them, and <i>falling</i> in folds
through their ravines, (the obliquely descending clouds of
the entering chorus in Aristophanes); secondly, the ascending
cloud, which develops itself loosely and independently
as it rises, and does not attach itself to the hill-side, while the
falling veil cloud clings to it close all the way down;&mdash;and
lastly the throned cloud, which rests indeed on the mountain
summit, with its base, but rises high above into the sky, continually
changing its outlines, but holding its seat perhaps
all day long.
</p><p>
These three forms of cloud belong exclusively to calm
weather; attached drift cloud, (see <a href="#FNanchor_11_11">Note 11</a>) can only be
formed in the wind.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> 'Glaciers of the Alps,' page 10.&mdash;"Let a pound
weight be placed upon a cube of granite" (size of supposed
cube not mentioned), "the cube is flattened, though in an
infinitesimal degree. Let the weight be removed, the cube
remains a little flattened. Let us call the cube thus flattened
No. 1. Starting with No. 1 as a new mass, let the pound
weight be laid upon it. We have a more flattened mass, No. 2....
Apply this to squeezed rocks, to those, for example,
which form the base of an obelisk like the Matterhorn,&mdash;the
conclusion seems inevitable <i>that the mountain is sinking by
its own weight</i>," etc., etc. Similarly the Nelson statue must
be gradually flattening the Nelson column, and in time
Cleopatra's needle will be as flat as her pincushion?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> 'Glaciers of the Alps,' page 146.&mdash;"The sun was near
the western horizon, and I remained alone upon the Grat to
see his last beams illuminate the mountains, which, with one
exception, were without a trace of cloud.
</p><p>
"This exception was the Matterhorn, the appearance of
which was extremely instructive. The obelisk appeared to
be divided in two halves by a vertical line, drawn from its
summit half-way down, to the windward of which we had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38">[38]</a></span>
bare cliffs of the mountain; and to the left of it a cloud which
appeared to cling tenaciously to the rocks.
</p><p>
"In reality, however, there was no clinging; the condensed
vapor incessantly got away, but it was ever renewed, and
thus a river of cloud had been sent from the mountain over
the valley of Aosta. The wind, in fact, blew lightly up the
valley of St. Nicholas, charged with moisture, and when the
air that held it <i>rubbed against the cold cone</i> of the Matterhorn,
the vapor was chilled and precipitated in his lee."
</p><p>
It is not explained, why the wind was not chilled by rubbing
against any of the neighboring mountains, nor why the
cone of the Matterhorn, mostly of rock, should be colder
than cones of snow. The phenomenon was first described
by De Saussure, who gives the same explanation as Tyndall;
and from whom, in the first volume of 'Modern Painters,' I
adopted it without sufficient examination. Afterwards I
re-examined it, and showed its fallacy, with respect to the cap
or helmet cloud, in the fifth volume of 'Modern Painters,'
page 124, in the terms given in the subjoined note,<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> but I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39">[39]</a></span>still retained the explanation of Saussure for the lee-side
cloud, engraving in plate 69 the modes of its occurrence on
the Aiguille Dru, of which the most ordinary one was afterwards
represented by Tyndall in his 'Glaciers of the Alps,'
under the title of 'Banner-cloud.' Its less imaginative
title, in 'Modern Painters,' of 'Lee-side cloud,' is more comprehensive,
for this cloud forms often under the brows of
far-terraced precipices, where it has no resemblance to a banner.
No true explanation of it has ever yet been given; for
the first condition of the problem has hitherto been unobserved,&mdash;namely,
that such cloud is constant in certain states
of weather, under precipitous rocks;&mdash;but never developed
with distinctness by domes of snow.
</p>
<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/19th-illus.jpg" width="468" height="260" alt="Wind flow diagram" title="Wind flow diagram" />
</p>
<p>
But my former expansion of Saussure's theory is at least
closer to the facts than Professor Tyndall's "rubbing against
the rocks," and I therefore allow room for it here, with its
illustrative wood-cut.
</p><p>
"When a moist wind blows in clear weather over a cold
summit, it has not time to get chilled as it approaches the
rock, and therefore the air remains clear, and the sky bright
on the windward side; but under the lee of the peak, there is
partly a back eddy, and partly still air; and in that lull and
eddy the wind gets time to be chilled by the rock, and the
cloud appears, as a boiling mass of white vapor, rising continually
with the return current to the upper edge of the
mountain, where it is caught by the straight wind and
partly torn, partly melted away in broken fragments.
</p><p>
"In the accompanying figure, the dark mass represents the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mountain peak, the arrow the main direction of the wind,
the curved lines show the directions of such current and its
concentration, and the dotted line encloses the space in which
cloud forms densely, floating away beyond and above in
irregular tongues and flakes."
</p></div>
<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_A_12" id="Footnote_A_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_12"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> "But both Saussure and I ought to have known,&mdash;we did know, but
did not think of it,&mdash;that the covering or cap-cloud forms on hot summits
as well as cold ones;&mdash;that the red and bare rocks of Mont Pilate, hotter,
certainly, after a day's sunshine than the cold storm-wind which sweeps
to them from the Alps, nevertheless have been renowned for their helmet
of cloud, ever since the Romans watched the cloven summit, gray against
the south, from the ramparts of Vindonissa, giving it the name from
which the good Catholics of Lucerne have warped out their favorite piece
of terrific sacred biography. And both my master and I should also have
reflected that if our theory about its formation had been generally true,
the helmet cloud ought to form on every cold summit, at the approach of
rain, in approximating proportions to the bulk of the glaciers; which is
so far from being the case that not only (<span class="smcap">A</span>) the cap-cloud may often be
seen on lower summits of grass or rock, while the higher ones are splendidly
clear (which may be accounted for by supposing the wind containing
the moisture not to have risen so high); but (<span class="smcap">B</span>) the cap-cloud
always shows a preference for hills of a conical form, such as the Mole or
Niesen, which can have very little power in chilling the air, even supposing
they were cold themselves; while it will entirely refuse to form
huge masses of mountain, which, supposing them of chilly temperament,
must have discomforted the atmosphere in their neighborhood for leagues."

the words 'aqueous molecules,' alike of water liquid or

temperatures water-dust becomes water-gas; and still less,
supposing pure water-gas blue, and pure air blue, what are
the changes in either which make them what sailors call
"dirty "; but it is one of the worst omissions of the previous
lecture, that I have not stated among the characters of the
plague-cloud that it is <i>always</i> dirty,<a name="FNanchor_A_14" id="FNanchor_A_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_14" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and <i>never blue under

brightness with calm of air.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_16" id="Footnote_14_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_16"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> 'Reflected.'&mdash;The reader must be warned in this place
of the difference implied by my use of the word 'cast' in
<a href="#Page_11">page 11</a>, and 'reflected' here: that is to say, between light or
color which an object possesses, whatever the angle it is seen
at, and the light which it reverberates at one angle only.
The Alps, under the rose<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of sunset, are exactly of the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42">[42]</a></span>color whether you see them from Berne or Schaffhausen.
But the gilding to our eyes of a burnished cloud depends, I
believe, at least for a measure of its luster, upon the angle
at which the rays incident upon it are reflected to the eye,
just as much as the glittering of the sea beneath it&mdash;or the
sparkling of the windows of the houses on the shore.
</p><p>
Previously, at <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>, in calling the molecules of transparent
atmospheric 'absolutely' unreflective of light, I mean,
in like manner, unreflective from their <i>surfaces</i>. Their blue
color seen against a dark ground is indeed a kind of reflection,
but one of which I do not understand the nature. It is seen
most simply in wood smoke, blue against trees, brown against
clear light; but in both cases the color is communicated to
(or left in) the <i>transmitted</i> rays.
</p><p>
So also the green of the sky (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>) is said to be given by
transmitted light, yellow rays passing through blue air: much
yet remains to be known respecting translucent colors of this
kind; only let them always be clearly distinguished in our
minds from the firmly possessed color of opaque substances,
like grass or malachite.
</p></div>
<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_A_17" id="Footnote_A_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_17"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> In speaking, at <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a> of the first lecture, of the limits of depth in the
rose-color cast on snow, I ought to have noted the greater strength of the
tint possible under the light of the tropics. The following passage, in
Mr. Cunningham's 'Natural History of the Strait of Magellan,' is to me
of the greatest interest, because of the beautiful effect described as seen
on the occasion of his visit to "the small town of Santa Rosa," (near
Valparaiso.) "The day, though clear, had not been sunny, so that,
although the snowy heights of the Andes had been distinctly visible
throughout the greater part of our journey, they had not been illuminated
by the rays of the sun. But now, as we turned the corner of a street, the
chain of the Cordillera suddenly burst on our gaze in such a blaze of
splendor that it almost seemed as if the windows of heaven had been
opened for a moment, permitting a flood of <i>crimson</i> light to stream forth
upon the snow. The sight was so unexpected, and so transcendently
magnificent, that a breathless silence fell upon us for a few moments,
while even the driver stopped his horses. This deep red glow lasted for
three or four minutes, and then rapidly faded into that lovely rosy hue so
characteristic of snow at sunset among the Alps."
</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_18" id="Footnote_15_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_18"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Diffraction.&mdash;Since these passages were written, I
have been led, in conversation with a scientific friend, to
doubt my statement that the colored portions of the lighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43">[43]</a></span>
clouds were brighter than the white ones. He was convinced
that the resolution of the rays would diminish their power,
and in <i>thinking</i> over the matter, I am disposed to agree with
him, although my impression at the time has been always
that the diffracted colors rose out of the white, as a rainbow
does out of the gray. But whatever the facts may be, in this
respect the statement in the text of the impossibility of
representing diffracted color in painting is equally true. It
may be that the resolved hues are darker than the white, as
colored panes in a window are darker than the colorless glass,
but all are alike in a key which no artifice of painting can
approach.
</p><p>
For the rest, the phenomena of diffraction are not yet
arranged systematically enough to be usefully discussed;
some of them involving the resolution of the light, and others
merely its intensification. My attention was first drawn to
them near St. Laurent, on the Jura mountains, by the vivid
reflection, (so it seemed), of the image of the sun from a
particular point of a cloud in the west, after the sun itself
was beneath the horizon: but in this image there were no
prismatic colors, neither is the constantly seen metamorphosis
of pine forests into silver filigree on ridges behind which the
sun is rising or setting, accompanied with any prismatic hue;
the trees become luminous, but not iridescent: on the other
hand, in his great account of his ascent of Mont Blanc with
Mr. Huxley, Professor Tyndall thus describes the sun's remarkable
behavior on that occasion:&mdash;"As we attained the
brow which forms the entrance to the Grand Plateau, he
<i>hung his disk upon a spike of rock</i> to our left, and, surrounded
by a glory of interference spectra of the most gorgeous colors,
blazed down upon us." ('Glaciers of the Alps,' p. 76.)
</p><p>
Nothing irritates me more, myself, than having the color
of my own descriptions of phenomena in anywise attributed
by the reader to accidental states either of my mind or
body;&mdash;but I cannot, for once, forbear at least the innocent
question to Professor Tyndall, whether the extreme beauty
of these 'interference spectra' may not have been partly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44">[44]</a></span>
owing to the extreme <i>sobriety</i> of the observer? no refreshment,
it appears, having been attainable the night before at the
Grands Mulets, except the beverage diluted with dirty snow,
of which I have elsewhere quoted the Professor's pensive
report,&mdash;"my memory of that tea is not pleasant."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_19" id="Footnote_16_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_19"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> 'Either stationary or slow in motion, reflecting unresolved
light.'
</p><p>
The rate of motion is of course not essentially connected
with the method of illumination; their connection, in this
instance, needs explanation of some points which could not
be dealt with in the time of a single lecture.
</p><p>
It is before said, with reserve only, that "a cloud is where
it is seen, and is not where it is not seen." But thirty years
ago, in 'Modern Painters,' I pointed out (see the paragraph
quoted in note 8th), the extreme difficulty of arriving at the
cause of cloud outline, or explaining how, if we admitted at
any given moment the atmospheric moisture to be generally
diffused, it could be chilled by formal <i>chills</i> into formal
clouds. How, for instance, in the upper cirri, a thousand
little chills, alternating with a thousand little warmths,
could stand still as a thousand little feathers.
</p><p>
But the first step to any elucidation of the matter is in the
firmly fixing in our minds the difference between windless
clouds, unaffected by any conceivable local accident, and
windy clouds, affected by some change in their circumstances
as they move.
</p><p>
In the sunset at Abbeville, represented in my first diagram,
the air is absolutely calm at the ground surface, and the
motion of its upper currents extremely slow. There is no
local reason assignable for the presence of the cirri above, or
of the thundercloud below. There is no conceivable cause
either in the geology, or the moral character, of the two sides
of the town of Abbeville, to explain why there should be
decorative fresco on the sky over the southern suburb, and a
muttering heap of gloom and danger over the northern. The
electric cloud is as calm in motion as the harmless one; it
changes its forms, indeed; but imperceptibly; and, so far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45">[45]</a></span>
can be discerned, only at its own will is exalted, and with its
own consent abased.
</p><p>
But in my second diagram are shown forms of vapor
sustaining at every instant all kinds of varying local influences;
beneath, fastened down by mountain attraction, above,
flung afar by distracting winds; here, spread abroad into
blanched sheets beneath the sunshine, and presently gathered
into strands of coiled cordage in the shade. Their total
existence is in metamorphosis, and their every aspect a surprise,
or a deceit.</p></div>

</p><p>
My impression that these clouds were glacial was at once
confirmed by a member of my audience, Dr. John Rae, in
conversation after the lecture, in which he communicated
to me the perfectly definite observations which he has had the
kindness to set down with their dates for me, in the following
letter:&mdash;
</p><p>
</p><div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate"><br />
"4, <span class="smcap">Addison Gardens, Kensington</span>, <i>4th Feb., 1884.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have looked up my old journal of thirty
years ago, written in pencil because it was impossible to keep
ink unfrozen in the snow-hut in which I passed the winter
of 1853-4, at Repulse Bay, on the Arctic Circle.<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
</p><p>
On the 1st of February, 1854, I find the following:&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46">[46]</a></span>
</p><p>
'A beautiful appearance of some cirrus clouds near the
sun, the central part of the cloud being of a fine pink or red,
then green, and pink fringe. This continued for about a
quarter of an hour. The same was observed on the 27th of
the month, but not so bright. Distance of clouds from sun,
from 3&deg; to 6&deg;.'
</p><p>
On the 1st February the temperature was 38&deg; below zero,
and on the 27th February 26&deg; below.
</p><p>
'On the 23d and 30th (of March) the same splendid
appearance of clouds as mentioned in last month's journal
was observed. On the first of these days, about 10.30 a.m.,
it was extremely beautiful. The clouds were about 8&deg; or 10&deg;
from the sun, below him and slightly to the eastward,&mdash;having
a green fringe all round, then pink; the center part at
first green, and then pink or red.'
</p><p>
The temperature was 21&deg; below zero, Fahrenheit.
</p><p>
There may have been other colors&mdash;blue, perhaps&mdash;but I
merely noted the most prominent; and what I call green may
have been bluish, although I do not mention this last color
in my notes.
</p><p>
From the lowness of the temperature at the time, the
clouds <i>must</i> have been frozen moisture.
</p><p>
The phenomenon is by no means common, even in the
Arctic zone.
</p><p>
The second beautiful cloud-picture shown this afternoon
brought so visibly to my memory the appearance seen by
me as above described, that I could not avoid remarking
upon it.
</p><p>
</p>
<p class="quotsig2">
Believe me very truly yours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">John Rae</span>." (M.D., F.R.S.)</span><br />
</p></div>
<p>
Now this letter enables me to leave the elements of your
problem for you in very clear terms.
</p><p>
Your sky&mdash;altogether&mdash;may be composed of one or more
of four things:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
Molecules of water in warm weather.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Molecules of ice in cold weather.<br />
Molecules of water-vapor in warm weather.<br />
Molecules of ice-vapor in cold weather.<br />
</p></div>
<p>
But of the size, distances, or modes of attraction between
these different kinds of particles, I find no definite information
anywhere, except the somewhat vague statement by
Sir William Thomson, that "if a drop of water could be
magnified so as to be as large as the earth, and have a diameter
of eight thousand miles, then a molecule of this water
in it would appear <i>somewhat larger than a shot</i>." (What
kind of shot?) "<i>and somewhat smaller than a cricket-ball</i>"!
</p><p>
And as I finally review the common accounts given of cloud
formation, I find it quite hopeless for the general reader to
deal with the quantity of points which have to be kept in
mind and severally valued, before he can account for any
given phenomena. I have myself, in many of the passages
of 'Modern Painters' before referred to, conceived of cloud
too narrowly as always produced by <i>cold</i>, whereas the temperature
of a cloud must continually, like that of our visible
breath in frosty weather, or of the visible current of steam,
or the smoking of a warm lake surface under sudden frost,
be above that of the surrounding atmosphere; and yet I never
remember entering a cloud without being chilled by it, and
the darkness of the plague-wind, unless in electric states of
the air, is always accompanied by deadly chill.
</p><p>
Nor, so far as I can read, has any proper account yet been
given of the balance, in serene air, of the warm air under the
cold, in which the warm air is at once compressed by weight,
and expanded by heat, and the cold air is thinned by its
elevation, yet contracted by its cold. There is indeed no
possibility of embracing the conditions in a single sentence,
any more than in a single thought. But the practical balance
is effected in calm air, so that its lower strata have no tendency
to rise, like the air in a fire balloon, nor its higher
strata to fall, unless they congeal into rain or snow.
</p><p>
I believe it will be an extreme benefit to my younger
readers if I write for them a little 'Grammar of Ice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Air,' collecting the known facts on all these matters, and I
am much minded to put by my ecclesiastical history for a
while, in order to relate what is legible of the history of the
visible Heaven.</p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_A_21" id="Footnote_A_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_21"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> I trust that Dr. Rae will forgive my making the reader better aware
of the real value of this communication by allowing him to see also the
following passage from the kind private letter by which it was supplemented:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Many years in the Hudson's Bay Company's service, I and my men
became educated for Arctic work, in which I was five different times
employed, in two of which expeditions we lived wholly by our own hunting
and fishing for twelve months, once in a stone house (very disagreeable),
and another winter in a snow hut (better), <i>without fire of any
kind to warm us</i>. On the first of these expeditions, 1846-7, my little party,
there being no officer but myself, surveyed seven hundred miles of coast
of Arctic America by a sledge journey, which Parry, Ross, Bach, and
Lyon had failed to accomplish, costing the country about &pound;70,000 or
&pound;80,000 at the lowest computation. The total expense of my little party,
including my own pay, was under fourteen hundred pounds sterling.
</p><p>
"My Arctic work has been recognized by the award of the founder's
gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society (before the completion of
the whole of it)."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_22" id="Footnote_18_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_22"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> 'You can't get a billiard ball to fall a shivering on its
own account.'&mdash;I am under correction in this statement by
the Lucasian professor of Cambridge, with respect to the
molecules of bodies capable of 'epipolizing' light. "Nothing
seems more natural than to suppose that the incident
vibrations of the luminiferous ether produce vibratory movements
among the ultimate molecules of sensitive substances,
and that the molecules in return, <i>swinging on their own
account</i>, produce vibrations in the luminous ether, and thus
cause the sensation of light. The periodic times of these
vibrations depend upon the periods in which the molecules
are <i>disposed to swing</i>." ('On the Changes of Refrangibility
of Light,' p. 549.)
</p><p>
It seems to me a pleasant conclusion, this, of recent
science, and suggestive of a perfectly regenerate theology.
The 'Let there be light' of the former Creation is first
expanded into 'Let there be a disposition of the molecules
to swing,' and the destinies of mankind, no less than the
vitality of the universe, depend thereafter upon this amiable,
but perhaps capricious, and at all events not easily influenced
or anticipated, disposition!
</p><p>
Is it not also strange that in a treatise entering into so
high mathematical analysis as that from which I quote, the
false word 'swing,' expressing the action of a body liable
to continuous arrest by gravitation, should be employed to
signify the oscillation, wholly unaffected by gravity, of substance
in which the motion once originated, may cease only
with the essence of the body?
</p><p>
It is true that in men of high scientific caliber, such as
the writer in this instance, carelessness in expression does
not affect the security of their conclusions. But in men of
lower rank, mental defects in language indicate fatal flaws in
thought. And although the constant habit to which I owe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my (often foolishly praised) "command of language"&mdash;of
never allowing a sentence to pass proof in which I have not
considered whether, for the vital word in it, a better could
be found in the dictionary, makes me somewhat morbidly
intolerant of careless diction, it may be taken for an
extremely useful and practical rule, that if a man can think
clearly he will write well, and that no good science was ever
written in bad English. So that, before you consider whether
a scientific author says a true or a false thing, you had better
first look if he is able properly to say <i>any</i>thing,&mdash;and
secondly, whether his conceit permits him to say anything
properly.
</p><p>
Thus, when Professor Tyndall, endeavoring to write
poetically of the sun, tells you that "The Lilies of the field
are his workmanship," you may observe, first, that since the
sun is not a man, nothing that he does is workmanship;
while even the figurative statement that he rejoices <i>as</i> a
strong man to run his course, is one which Professor Tyndall
has no intention whatever of admitting. And you may then
observe, in the second place, that, if even in that figurative
sense, the lilies of the field are the sun's workmanship, in the
same sense the lilies of the hothouse are the stove's workmanship,&mdash;and
in perfectly logical parallel, you, who are alive
here to listen to me, because you have been warmed and fed
through the winter, are the workmanship of your own coal-scuttles.
</p><p>
Again, when Mr. Balfour Stewart begins a treatise on the
'Conservation of Energy,' which is to conclude, as we shall
see presently, with the prophecy of its total extinction as
far as the present world is concerned,&mdash;by clothing in a
"properly scientific garb," our innocent impression that
there is some difference between the blow of a rifle stock and a
rifle ball; he prepares for the scientific toilet by telling us
in italics that "the something which the rifle ball possesses
in contradistinction to the rifle stock is clearly the power of
overcoming resistance," since "it can penetrate through oak-wood
or through water&mdash;or (alas! that it should be so often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tried) through the human body; and <i>this power of penetration</i>"
(italics now mine) "<i>is the distinguishing characteristic
of a substance moving with very great velocity</i>. Let
us define by the term 'Energy,' this power which the rifle
ball possesses of overcoming obstacles, or of doing work."
</p><p>
Now, had Mr. Stewart been a better scholar, he would have
felt, even if he had not known, that the Greek word 'energy'
could only be applied to the living&mdash;and of living, with
perfect propriety only to the <i>mental</i>, action of animals, and
that it could no more be applied as a 'scientific garb,' to the
flight of a rifle ball, than to the fall of a dead body. And, if
he had attained thus much, even of the science of language,
it is just possible that the small forte and faculty of thought
he himself possesses might have been energized so far as to
perceive that the force of all inertly moving bodies, whether
rifle stock, rifle ball, or rolling world, is under precisely one
and the same relation to their weights and velocities; that
the effect of their impact depends&mdash;not merely on their pace,
but their constitution; and on the relative forms and stability
of the substances they encounter, and that there is no
more quality of Energy, though much less quality of Art,
in the swiftly penetrating shot, or crushing ball, than in the
deliberately contemplative and administrative puncture by a
gnat's proboscis, or a seamstress' needle.
</p><p>
Mistakes of this kind, beginning with affectations of diction,
do not always invalidate general statements or conclusions,&mdash;for
a bad writer often equivocates out of a blunder
as he equivocates into one,&mdash;but I have been strict in pointing
out the confusions of idea admitted in scientific books between
the movement of a swing, that of a sounding violin chord,
and that of an agitated liquid, because these confusions have
actually enabled Professor Tyndall to keep the scientific
world in darkness as to the real nature of glacier motion for
the last twenty years; and to induce a resultant quantity of
aberration in the scientific mind concerning glacial erosion,
of which another twenty years will scarcely undo the damage.</p></div>

the careless terminology on which I have dwelt in the above
note has left unsettled, I believe the reader will be surprised,
as much as I am myself, to find that of the mode of impulse in
a common gust of wind! Whence is its strength communicated
to it, and how gathered in it? and what is the difference
of manner in the impulse between compressible gas and incompressible
fluid? For instance: The water at the head of a
weir is passing every instant from slower into quicker motion;
but (until broken in the air) the fast flowing water is just as
dense as the slowly flowing water. But a fan alternately compresses
and rarefies the air between it and the cheek, and the
violence of a destructive gust in a gale of wind means a
momentary increase in velocity and density of which I cannot
myself in the least explain,&mdash;and find in no book on dynamics
explained,&mdash;the mechanical causation.

The following letter, from a friend whose observations on
natural history for the last seven or eight years have been
consistently valuable and instructive to me, will be found,
with that subjoined in the note, in various ways interesting;

instrumental registry in such matters:&mdash;

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Ruskin</span>,&mdash;Some time since I troubled you
with a note or two about sea-birds, etc.... but perhaps
I should never have ventured to trouble you again, had not
your lecture on the 'Storm Clouds' touched a subject which
has deeply interested me for years past. I had, of course, no
idea that you had noticed this thing, though I might have
known that, living the life you do, you must have done so. As
for me, it has been a source of perplexity for years: so much
so, that I began to wonder at times whether I was not under
some mental delusion about it, until the strange theatrical
displays, of the last few months, for which I was more or less
prepared, led so many to use their eyes, unmuzzled by brass or
glass, for a time. I know you do not bother, or care much to
read newspapers, but I have taken the liberty of cutting out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and sending a letter of mine, sent on the 1st January to an
evening paper,<a name="FNanchor_A_24" id="FNanchor_A_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_24" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> upon this subject, thinking you might like to
know that one person, at any rate, has seen that strange,
bleared look about the sun, shining so seldom except through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a ghastly glare of pale, persistent haze. May it be that the
singular coloring of the sunsets marks an end of this long
period of plague-cloud, and that in them we have promise of
steadier weather? (No: those sunsets were entirely distinct
phenomena, and promised, if anything, only evil.&mdash;R.)
</p><p>
I was glad to see that in your lecture you gave the dependants
upon the instrument-makers a warning. On the 26th I
had a heavy sailing-boat lifted and blown, from where she lay
hauled up, a distance of four feet, which, as the boat has four
hundred-weight of iron upon her keel, gives a wind-gust, or
force, not easily measured by instruments.

</p><p>
I am especially delighted, in this letter, by my friend's
vigorously accurate expression, eyes "unmuzzled by brass or
glass." I have had occasion continually, in my art-lectures,
to dwell on the great law of human perception and power, that
the beauty which is good for us is prepared for the natural
focus of the sight, and the sounds which are delightful to us
for the natural power of the nerves of the ear; and the art
which is admirable in us, is the exercise of our own bodily
powers, and not carving by sand-blast, nor oratorizing through
a speaking trumpet, nor dancing with spring heels. But
more recently, I have become convinced that even in matters
of science, although every added mechanical power has its
proper use and sphere, yet the things which are vital to our
happiness and prosperity can only be known by the rational
use and subtle skill of our natural powers. We may trust the
instrument with the prophecy of storm, or registry of rainfall;
but the conditions of atmospheric change, on which
depend the health of animals and fruitfulness of seeds, can
only be discerned by the eye and the bodily sense.
</p><p>
Take, for simplest and nearest example, this question of the
stress of wind. It is not the actual <i>power</i> that is immeasurable,
if only it would stand to be measured! Instruments
could easily now be invented which would register not only a
blast that could lift a sailing boat, but one that would sink
a ship of the line. But, lucklessly&mdash;the blast won't pose to
the instrument! nor can the instrument be adjusted to the
blast. In the gale of which my friend speaks in his next
letter, 26th January, a gust came down the hill above Coniston
village upon two old oaks, which were well rooted in the slate
rock, and some fifty or sixty feet high&mdash;the one, some twenty
yards below the other. The blast tore the highest out of the
ground, peeling its roots from the rock as one peels an orange&mdash;swept
the head of the lower tree away with it in one ruin,
and snapped the two leader branches of the upper one over
the other's stump, as one would break one's cane over some
people's heads, if one got the chance. In wind action of this
kind the amount of actual force used is the least part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[55]</a></span>
business;&mdash;it is the suddenness of its concentration, and the
lifting and twisting strength, as of a wrestler, which make
the blast fatal; none of which elements of storm-power can
be recognized by mechanical tests. In my friend's next letter,
however, he gives us some evidence of the <i>consistent</i>
strength of this same gale, and of the electric conditions which
attended it:&mdash;the prefatory notice of his pet bird I had meant
for 'Love's Meinie,' but it will help us through the grimness
of our studies here.

<p>
My small blackheaded gull Jack is still flourishing, and
the time is coming when I look for that singularly sudden
change in the plumage of his head which took place last
March. I have asked all my ocean-going friends to note
whether these little birds are not the gulls <i>par excellence</i> of
the sea; and so far all I have heard from them confirms this.
It seems almost incredible; but my son, a sailor, who met
that hurricane of the 26th of January, writes to me to say
that out in the Bay of Biscay on the morning after the gale,
'though it was blowing like blazes, I observed some little
gulls of Jacky's species, and they followed us half way across
the Bay, seeming to find shelter under the lee of our ship.
Some alighted now and then, and rested upon the water as if
tired.' When one considers that these birds must have been
at sea all that night somewhere, it gives one a great idea of
their strength and endurance. My son's ship, though a
powerful ocean steamer, was for two whole hours battling
head to sea off the Eddystone that night, and for that time
the lead gave no increase of soundings, so that she could have
made no headway during those two hours; while all the time
her yards had the St. Elmo's fire at their ends, looking as
though a blue light was burning at each yard-arm, and this
was about all they could see.

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I read with great interest your first lecture
at Oxford on cloud and wind (very indifferently reported in
'The Times'). You have given a name to a wind I've known
for years. You call it the plague&mdash;I call it the devil-wind:
<i>e. g.</i>, on April 29th, 1882, morning warmer, then rain storms
from east; afternoon, rain squalls; wind, west by south,
rough; barometer falling awfully; 4.30 p.m., tremendous
wind.&mdash;April 30th, all the leaves of the trees, all plants black
and dead, as if a fiery blast had swept over them. <i>All the
hedges on windward side black as black tea.</i>
</p><p>
Another devil-wind came towards the end of last summer.
The next day, all the leaves were falling sere and yellow, as
if it were late autumn.

</p></div>
<p>
I remember both these blights well; they were entirely
terrific; but only sudden maxima of the constant morbific
power of this wind;&mdash;which, if Mr. Birkett saw my <i>personal</i>
notices of, intercalated among the scientific ones, he would
find alluded to in terms quite as vigorously damning as he
could desire: and the actual effect of it upon my thoughts and
work has been precisely that which would have resulted from
the visible phantom of an evil spirit, the absolute opponent
of the Queen of the Air,&mdash;Typhon against Athena,&mdash;in a
sense of which I had neither the experience nor the conception
when I wrote the illustrations of the myth of Perseus in
'Modern Painters.' Not a word of all those explanations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Homer and Pindar could have been written in weather like
that of the last twelve years; and I am most thankful to have
got them written, before the shadow came, and I could still
see what Homer and Pindar saw. I quote one passage only&mdash;Vol.
v., p. 141&mdash;for the sake of a similitude which reminds
me of one more thing I have to say here&mdash;and a bit of its
note&mdash;which I think is a precious little piece, not of word-painting,
but of simply told feeling&mdash;(<i>that</i>, if people knew
it, is my real power).
</p><p>
"On the Yorkshire and Derbyshire hills, when the rain-cloud
is low and much broken, and the steady west wind fills
all space with its strength,<a name="FNanchor_B_25" id="FNanchor_B_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_25" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> the sun-gleams fly like golden
vultures; they are flashes rather than shinings; the dark
spaces and the dazzling race and skim along the acclivities,
and dart and <i>dip from crag to dell, swallow-like</i>."
</p><p>
The dipping of the shadows here described of course is
caused only by that of the dingles they cross; but I have not
in any of my books yet dwelt enough on the difference of
character between the dipping and the mounting winds. Our
wildest phase of the west wind here at Coniston is 'swallow-like'
with a vengeance, coming down on the lake in swirls
which spurn the spray under them as a fiery horse does the
dust. On the other hand, the softly ascending winds express
themselves in the grace of their cloud motion, as if set to the
continuous music of a distant song.<a name="FNanchor_C_26" id="FNanchor_C_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_26" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>

'Modern Painters' or elsewhere, I speak of rate of flight in
clouds, I am thinking of it as measured by the horizontal
distance overpast in given time, and not as apparent only,
owing to the nearness of the spectator. All low clouds appear
to move faster than high ones, the pace being supposed equal
in both: but when I speak of quick or slow cloud, it is always
with respect to a given altitude. In a fine summer morning,
a cloud will wait for you among the pines, folded to and fro
among their stems, with a branch or two coming out here, and
a spire or two there: you walk through it, and look back to it.
At another time, on the same spot, the fury of cloud-flood
drifts past you like the Rhine at Schaffhausen.
</p><p>
The space even of the doubled lecture does not admit of
my entering into any general statement of the action of the
plague-cloud in Switzerland and Italy; but I must not omit
the following notes of its aspect in the high Alps.
</p><div class="blockquot"><p class="quotdate">
"<span class="smcap">Sallenches</span>, <i>11th September, 1882</i>.<br />
</p>
<p>
This morning, at half-past five, the Mont Blanc summit
was clear, and the greater part of the Aiguilles du Plan and
Midi clear dark&mdash;all, against pure cirri, lighted beneath by
sunrise; the sun of course not visible yet from the valley.
</p><p>
By seven o'clock, the plague-clouds had formed in <i>brown</i>
flakes, down to the base of the Aiguille de Bionassay; entirely
covering the snowy ranges; the sun, as it rose to us here, shone
only for about ten minutes&mdash;gilding in its old glory the range
of the Dorons,&mdash;before one had time to look from peak to
peak of it, the plague-cloud formed from the west, hid Mont<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Joli, and steadily choked the valley with advancing streaks
of dun-colored mist. Now&mdash;twenty minutes to nine&mdash;there is
not <i>one ray</i> of sunshine on the whole valley, or on its mountains,
from the Forclaz down to Cluse.
</p><p>
These phenomena are only the sequel of a series of still
more strange and sad conditions of the air, which have continued
among the Savoy Alps for the last eight days, (themselves
the sequel of others yet more general, prolonged, and
harmful). But the weather was perfectly fine at Dijon, and
I doubt not at Chamouni, on the 1st of this month. On the
2d, in the evening, I saw, from the Jura, heavy thunderclouds
in the west; on the 3d, the weather broke at Morez,
in hot thunder-showers, with intervals of scorching sun; on
the 4th, 5th, and 6th there was nearly continuous rain at St.
Cergues, the Alps being totally invisible all the time. The
sky cleared on the night of the 6th, and on the 7th I saw from
the top of the Dole all the western plateaux of Jura quite
clearly; but <i>the entire range of the Alps</i>, from the Moleson
to the Sal&egrave;ve, and all beyond,&mdash;snow, crag and hill-side,&mdash;were
wrapped and buried in one unbroken gray-brown winding-sheet,
of such cloud <i>as I had never seen till that day touch
an Alpine summit</i>.
</p><p>
The wind, from the east, (so that it blew <i>up</i> over the edge
of the Dole cliff, and admitted of perfect shelter on the slope
to the west,) was bitter cold, and extremely violent: the sun
overhead, bright enough, and remained so during the afternoon;
the plague-cloud reaching from the Alps only about as
far as the southern shore of the lake of Geneva; but we could
not see the Sal&egrave;ve; nor even the north shore, farther than
to Morges! I reached the Col de la Faucille at sunset, when,
for a few minutes, the Mont Blanc and Aiguille Verte
showed themselves in dull red light, but were buried again,
before the sun was quite down, in the rising deluge of cloud-poison.
I saw no farther than the Voirons and Brezon&mdash;and
scarcely those, during the electric heat of the 9th at Geneva;
and last Saturday and Sunday have been mere whirls and
drifts of indecisive, but always sullen, storm. This morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I saw the snows clear for the first time, having been, during
the whole past week, on steady watch for them.
</p><p>
I have written that the clouds of the 7th were such as I
never before saw on the Alps. Often, during the past ten
years, I have seen them on my own hills, and in Italy in
1874; but it has always chanced to be fine weather, or common
rain and cold, when I have been among the snowy chains;
and now from the Dole for the first time I saw the plague-cloud
on <i>them</i>."

<div class="footnote2"><p><br /><a name="Footnote_A_24" id="Footnote_A_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_24"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> '<span class="smcap">The Look of the Sky</span>.
</p><p class="center">
'<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Editor</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="smcap">St. James's Gazette</span>.
</p><p>
'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been a very constant though not a scientific observer of
the sky for a period of forty years; and I confess to a certain feeling of
astonishment at the way in which the "recent celestial phenomena"
seem to have taken the whole body of scientific observers by surprise. It
would even appear that something like these extraordinary sunsets was
necessary to call the attention of such observers to what has long been a
source of perplexity to a variety of common folk, like sailors, farmers,
and fishermen. But to such people the look of the weather, and what
comes of that look, is of far more consequence than the exact amount of
ozone or the depth or width of a band of the spectrum.
</p><p>
'Now, to all such observers, including myself, it has been plain that of
late neither the look of the sky nor the character of the weather has been,
as we should say, what it used to be; and those whose eyes were strong
enough to look now and then toward the sun have noticed a very marked
increase of what some would call a watery look about him, which might
perhaps be better expressed as a white sheen or glare, at times developing
into solar halo or mock suns, as noted in your paper of the 2d of October
last year. A fisherman would describe it as "white and davery-like."
So far as my observation goes, this appearance was only absent here for
a limited period during the present summer, when we had a week or
two of nearly normal weather; the summer before it was seldom absent.
</p><p>
'Again, those whose business or pleasure has depended on the use of
wind-power have all remarked the strange persistence of hard westerly
and easterly winds, the westerly ones at times partaking of an almost
trade-wind-like force and character. The summer of 1882 was especially
remarkable for these winds, while each stormy November has been followed
by a period about mid-winter of mild calm weather with dense fog. During
these strong winds in summer and early autumn the weather would
remain bright and sunny, and to a landsman would be not remarkable in
any way, while the barometer has been little affected by them; but it has
been often observed by those employed on the water that when it ceased
blowing half a gale the sky at once became overcast, with damp weather
or rain. This may all seem common enough to most people; but to those
accustomed to gauge the wind by the number of reefs wanted in a mainsail
or foresail it was not so; and the number of consecutive days when two
or more reefs have been kept tied down during the last few summers has
been remarkable&mdash;alternating at times with equally persistent spells of
calm and fog such as we are now passing through. Again, we have had
an unusually early appearance of ice in the Atlantic, and most abnormal
weather over Central Europe; while in a letter I have just received from
an old hand on board a large Australian clipper, he speaks of heavy gales
and big seas off that coast in almost the height of their summer.
</p><p>
'Now, upon all this, in our season of long twilights, we have bursting
upon us some clear weather; with a display of cloud-forms or vapor at
such an elevation that, looking at them one day through an opening in
the nearer clouds, they seemed so distant as to resemble nothing but the
delicate grain of ivory upon a billiard-ball. And yet with the fact that
two-thirds of this earth is covered with water, and bearing in mind the
effect which a very small increase of sun-power would have in producing
cloud and lifting it above its normal level for a time, we are asked to
believe that this sheen is all dust of some kind or other, in order to explain
what are now known as the "recent sunsets": though I venture to
think that we shall see more of them yet when the sun comes our way
again.
</p><p>
'At first sight, increased sun-power would seem to mean more sunshine;
but a little reflection would show us that this would not be for long, while
any considerable addition to the sun's power would be followed by such
a vast increase of vapor that we should only see him, in our latitudes, at
very short intervals. I am aware that all this is most unscientific; but
I have read column after column of explanation written by those who are
supposed to know all about such things, and find myself not a jot the
wiser for it. Do you know anybody who is?&mdash;I am, Sir, your obedient

Fiction in the 'Nineteenth Century,' he will find this word
carefully defined in its Scriptural, and evermore necessary,
meaning,&mdash;'Harmful speaking'&mdash;not against God only, but
against man, and against all the good works and purposes of
Nature. The word is accurately opposed to 'Euphemy,' the
right or well-speaking of God and His world; and the two
modes of speech are those which going out of the mouth
sanctify or defile the man.
</p><p>
Going out of the mouth, that is to say, deliberately and of
purpose. A French postilion's 'Sacr-r-r&eacute;'&mdash;loud, with the
low 'Nom de Dieu' following between his teeth, is not blasphemy,
unless against his horse;&mdash;but Mr. Thackeray's close
of his Waterloo chapter in 'Vanity Fair,' "And all the night
long Amelia was praying for George, who was lying on his
face dead with a bullet through his heart," is blasphemy of
the most fatal and subtle kind.
</p><p>
And the universal instinct of blasphemy in the modern
vulgar scientific mind is above all manifested in its love of
what is ugly, and natural inthrallment by the abominable;&mdash;so
that it is ten to one if, in the description of a new bird,
you learn much more of it than the enumerated species of
vermin that stick to its feathers; and in the natural history
museum of Oxford, humanity has been hitherto taught, not by
portraits of great men, but by the skulls of cretins.
</p><p>
But the <i>deliberate</i> blasphemy of science, the assertion of its
own virtue and dignity against the always implied, and often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[61]</a></span>
asserted, vileness of all men and&mdash;Gods,&mdash;heretofore, is the
most wonderful phenomenon, so far as I can read or perceive,
that hitherto has arisen in the always marvelous course of
the world's mental history.
</p><p>
Take, for brief general type, the following 92d paragraph
of the 'Forms of Water':&mdash;
</p><p>
"But while we thus acknowledge our limits, there is also
reason for wonder at the extent to which Science has mastered
the system of nature. From age to age and from generation
to generation, fact has been added to fact and law to law,
the true method and order of the Universe being thereby more
and more revealed. In doing this, Science has encountered
and overthrown various forms of superstition and deceit, of
credulity and imposture. But the world continually produces
weak persons and wicked persons, and as long as they continue
to exist side by side, as they do in this our day, very
debasing beliefs will also continue to infest the world."
</p><p>
The debasing beliefs meant being simply those of Homer,
David, and St. John<a name="FNanchor_A_28" id="FNanchor_A_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_28" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;as against a modern French gamin's.
And what the results of the intended education of English
gamins of every degree in that new higher theology will be,
England is I suppose by this time beginning to discern.
</p><p>
In the last 'Fors'<a name="FNanchor_B_29" id="FNanchor_B_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_29" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> which I have written, on education
of a safer kind, still possible, one practical point is insisted
on chiefly,&mdash;that learning by heart, and repetition with perfect
accent and cultivated voice, should be made quite principal
branches of school discipline up to the time of going to
the university.
</p><p>
And of writings to be learned by heart, among other passages
of indisputable philosophy and perfect poetry, I include
certain chapters of the&mdash;now for the most part forgotten&mdash;wisdom
of Solomon; and of these, there is one selected por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[62]</a></span>tion
which I should recommend not only school-boys and girls,
but persons of every age, if they don't know it, to learn
forthwith, as the shortest summary of Solomon's wisdom;&mdash;namely,
the seventeenth chapter of Proverbs, which being
only twenty-eight verses long, may be fastened in the dullest
memory at the rate of a verse a day in the shortest month of
the year. Out of the twenty-eight verses, I will read you
seven, for example of their tenor,&mdash;the last of the seven I will
with your good leave dwell somewhat upon. You have heard
the verses often before, but probably without remembering
that they are all in this concentrated chapter.
</p>
<div><ol>
<li><p>Verse 1.&mdash;Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
than a house full of good eating, with strife.
</p><p>
(Remember, in reading this verse, that though
England has chosen the strife, and set every man's
hand against his neighbor, her house is not yet so full
of good eating as she expected, even though she gets
half of her victuals from America.)
</p></li>
<li><p>Verse 3.&mdash;The fining pot is for silver, the furnace for
gold, but the Lord tries the heart.
</p><p>
(Notice the increasing strength of trial for the more
precious thing: only the melting-pot for the silver&mdash;the
fierce furnace for the gold&mdash;but the Fire of the
Lord for the heart.)
</p></li>
<li><p>Verse 4.&mdash;A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips.
</p><p>
(That means, for <i>you</i>, that, intending to live by
usury and swindling, you read Mr. Adam Smith and
Mr. Stuart Mill, and other such political economists.)
</p></li>
<li><p>Verse 5.&mdash;Whoso mocketh the poor, reproacheth his
Maker.
</p><p>
(Mocketh,&mdash;by saying that his poverty is his fault,
no less than his misfortune,&mdash;England's favorite
theory now-a-days.)
</p></li>
<li><p>Verse 12.&mdash;Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
rather than a fool in his folly.
</p><p>
(Carlyle is often now accused of false scorn in his
calling the passengers over London Bridge, "mostly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fools,"&mdash;on the ground that men are only to be justly
held foolish if their intellect is under, as only wise
when it is above, the average. But the reader will
please observe that the essential function of modern
education is to develop what capacity of mistake a
man has. Leave him at his forge and plow,&mdash;and
those tutors teach him his true value, indulge him in
no error, and provoke him to no vice. But take him
up to London,&mdash;give him her papers to read, and her
talk to hear,&mdash;and it is fifty to one you send him
presently on a fool's errand over London Bridge.)
</p></li>
<li><p>Now listen, for this verse is the question you have
mainly to ask yourselves about your beautiful all-over-England
system of competitive examination:&mdash;
</p><p>
Verse 16. Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a
fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?
</p><p>
(You know perfectly well it isn't the wisdom you
want, but the "station in life,"&mdash;and the money!)
</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, Verse 7.&mdash;Wisdom is before him that hath understanding,
but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of
the earth.
</p><p>
"And in the beginnings of it"! Solomon would
have written, had he lived in our day; but we will be
content with the ends at present. No scientific people,
as I told you at first, have taken any notice of the
more or less temporary phenomena of which I have
to-night given you register. But, from the constant
arrangements of the universe, the same respecting
which the thinkers of former time came to the conclusion
that they were essentially good, and to end
in good, the modern speculator arrives at the quite
opposite and extremely uncomfortable conclusion that
they are essentially evil, and to end&mdash;in nothing.
</p></li>

</div>
<p>And I have here a volume,<a name="FNanchor_C_30" id="FNanchor_C_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_30" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> before quoted, by a very foolish
and very lugubrious author, who in his concluding chapter
gives us,&mdash;founded, you will observe, on a series of 'ifs,'&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[64]</a></span>
latest scientific views concerning the order of creation. "We
have spoken already about a medium pervading space"&mdash;this
is the Scientific God, you observe, differing from the unscientific
one, in that the purest in heart cannot see&mdash;nor the
softest in heart feel&mdash;this spacious Deity&mdash;a <i>Medium</i>, pervading
space&mdash;"the office of which" (italics all mine) "appears
to be to <i>degrade</i> and ultimately <i>extinguish</i>, all differential
motion. It has been well pointed out by Thomson, that,
looked at <i>in this light</i>, the universe is a system that had a
beginning and must have an end, for a process of degradation
cannot be eternal. If we could view the Universe as a candle
not lit, then it is perhaps conceivable to regard it as having
been always in existence; but if we regard it rather as a
candle that has been lit, we become absolutely certain that it
cannot have been burning from eternity, and that a time
will come when it will cease to burn. We are led to look to
a beginning in which the particles of matter were in a diffuse
chaotic state, but endowed with the power of gravitation; and
we are led to look to an end in which the whole Universe will
be one equally heated inert mass, <i>and from which everything
like life, or motion, or beauty, will have utterly gone away</i>."
</p><p>
Do you wish me to congratulate you on this extremely
cheerful result of telescopic and microscopic observation, and
so at once close my lecture? or may I venture yet to trespass
on your time by stating to you any of the more comfortable
views held by persons who did not regard the universe in
what my author humorously calls "this <i>light</i>"?
</p><p>
In the peculiarly characteristic notice with which the
'Daily News' honored my last week's lecture, that courteous
journal charged me, in the metaphorical term now classical
on Exchange, with "hedging," to conceal my own opinions.
The charge was not prudently chosen, since, of all men now
obtaining any portion of popular regard, I am pretty well
known to be precisely the one who cares least either for hedge
or ditch, when he chooses to go across country. It is certainly
true that I have not the least mind to pin my heart on
my sleeve, for the daily daw, or nightly owl, to peck at; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the essential reason for my not telling you my own opinions
on this matter is&mdash;that I do not consider them of material
consequence to you.
</p><p>
It <i>might</i> possibly be of some advantage for you to know
what&mdash;were he now living, Orpheus would have thought, or
&AElig;schylus, or a Daniel come to judgment, or John the Baptist,
or John the Son of Thunder; but what either you, or I, or any
other Jack or Tom of us all, think,&mdash;even if we knew what to
think,&mdash;is of extremely small moment either to the Gods, the
clouds, or ourselves.
</p><p>
Of myself, however, if you care to hear it, I will tell you
thus much: that had the weather when I was young been such
as it is now, no book such as 'Modern Painters' ever would
or <i>could</i> have been written; for every argument, and every
sentiment in that book, was founded on the personal experience
of the beauty and blessing of nature, all spring and
summer long; and on the then demonstrable fact that over a
great portion of the world's surface the air and the earth
were fitted to the education of the spirit of man as closely as
a school-boy's primer is to his labor, and as gloriously as a
lover's mistress is to his eyes.
</p><p>
That harmony is now broken, and broken the world round:
fragments, indeed, of what existed still exist, and hours of
what is past still return; but month by month the darkness
gains upon the day, and the ashes of the Antipodes glare
through the night.<a name="FNanchor_D_31" id="FNanchor_D_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_31" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66">[66]</a></span>
What consolation, or what courage, through plague, danger,
or darkness, you can find in the conviction that you are nothing
more than brute beasts driven by brute forces, your other
tutors can tell you&mdash;not I: but <i>this</i> I can tell you&mdash;and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the authority of all the masters of thought since time was
time,&mdash;that, while by no manner of vivisection you can learn
what a <i>Beast</i> is, by only looking into your own hearts you
may know what a <i>Man</i> is,&mdash;and know that his only true
happiness is to live in Hope of something to be won by him,
in Reverence of something to be worshiped by him, and in
Love of something to be cherished by him, and cherished&mdash;forever.
</p><p>
Having these instincts, his only rational conclusion is that
the objects which can fulfill them may be by his effort gained,
and by his faith discerned; and his only earthly wisdom is to
accept the united testimony of the men who have sought these
things in the way they were commanded. Of whom no single
one has ever said that his obedience or his faith had been
vain, or found himself cast out from the choir of the living
souls, whether here, or departed, for whom the song was
written:&mdash;

of last autumn had been proved to be connected with the flight of volcanic
ashes. This has been since, I hear, disproved again. Whatever
their cause, those sunsets were, in the sense in which I myself use the
word, altogether 'unnatural' and terrific: but they have no connection
with the far more fearful, because protracted and increasing, power of the
Plague-wind. The letter from White's 'History of Selborne,' quoted by
the Rev. W. R. Andrews in his letter to the 'Times,' (dated January 8th)
seems to describe aspects of the sky like these of 1883, just a hundred
years before, in 1783: and also some of the circumstances noted, especially
the variation of the wind to all quarters without alteration in the air, correspond
with the character of the plague-wind; but the fog of 1783 made
the sun dark, with iron-colored rays&mdash;not pale, with blanching rays. I
subjoin Mr. Andrews' letter, extremely valuable in its collation of the
records of simultaneous volcanic phenomena; praying the reader also to
observe the instantaneous acknowledgment, by the true 'Naturalist,' of
horror in the violation of beneficent natural law.

"<span class="smcap">The Recent Sunsets and Volcanic Eruptions</span>.
</p><p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It may, perhaps, be interesting at the present time, when so
much attention has been given to the late brilliant sunsets and sunrises,
to be reminded that almost identically the same appearances were observed
just a hundred years ago.
</p><p>
Gilbert White writes in the year 1783, in his 109th letter, published in
his 'Natural History of Selborne':&mdash;
</p><div class="blockquot3"><p>
'The summer of the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one,
and full of horrible phenomena; for besides the alarming meteors and
tremendous thunderstorms that affrighted and distressed the different
counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze or smoky fog that prevailed
for many weeks in this island and in every part of Europe, and even
beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything
known within the memory of man. By my journal I find that I had
noticed this strange occurrence from June 23d to July 20th inclusive,
during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making
any alteration in the air. The sun at noon looked as black as a clouded
moon, and shed a ferruginous light on the ground and floors of rooms, but
was particularly lurid and blood-colored at rising and setting. The
country people began to look with a superstitious awe at the red lowering
aspect of the sun; and, indeed, there was reason for the most enlightened
person to be apprehensive, for all the while Calabria and part of the Isle
of Sicily were torn and convulsed with earthquakes, and about that juncture
a volcano sprang out of the sea on the coast of Norway.'
</p><p>
Other writers also mention volcanic disturbances in this same year,
1783. We are told by Lyell and Geikie, that there were great volcanic
eruptions in and near Iceland. A submarine volcano burst forth in the
sea, thirty miles southwest of Iceland, which ejected so much pumice
that the ocean was covered with this substance, to the distance of 150
miles, and ships were considerably impeded in their course; and a new
island was formed, from which fire and smoke and pumice were emitted.
</p><p>
Besides this submarine eruption, the volcano Skaptar-J&ouml;kull, on the
mainland, on June 11th, 1783, threw out a torrent of lava, so immense as
to surpass in magnitude the bulk of Mont Blanc, and ejected so vast an
amount of fine dust, that the atmosphere over Iceland continued loaded
with it for months afterwards. It fell in such quantities over parts of
Caithness&mdash;a distance of 600 miles&mdash;as to destroy the crops, and that year
is still spoken of by the inhabitants as the year of 'the ashie.'
</p><p>
These particulars are gathered from the text-books of Lyell and Geikie.
</p><p>
I am not aware whether the coincidence in time of the Icelandic eruptions,
and of the peculiar appearance of the sun, described by Gilbert
White, has yet been noticed; but this coincidence may very well be taken
as some little evidence towards explaining the connection between the
recent beautiful sunsets and the tremendous volcanic explosion of the Isle
of Krakatoa in August last.
